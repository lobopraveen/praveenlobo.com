> Life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming - 'WOW - What a Ride!'


Like everything else, a man changes with time. So does his dreams, desires, and abilities. The following is a list after all.

_Note: I should've kept a log of changes to this list. As of 2018, I will add the year in parentheses before change._

_(2018)_ As I read this list in 2018, I don't quite understand what the hell I was thinking putting this (and some other things around here) up on a blog for everyone to see. I cringed reading! I did think about taking it down; however, on a second thought, I will leave them here. They kind of show a snapshot of a time in my life and looking back now, it helps me see how I have changed. I will read it again someday in future and I'm sure I will go through this same feeling all over again!

---



1. Own a website and start a blog (that's where you are now)

1. Learn to swim - Well, I did teach myself how to swim (thanks to YouTube and the uploaders) but not very good.

1. Teach kids - I don't know what, but all I know is I want to be able to stand up in front of those innocent kids and teach them something they don't know. Guide them. Another thing I want to do is to teach at least some kids how to talk in English. I know how devastating it is not being able to converse in English.

1. Work with disaster recovery team - to help those who are rally in bad need of help.

1. Write a poem - I have. To people in my life, thanking them or wishing them, but  I don't know if they can be called as one. I have also lost them along the way.

1. Write a story

1. [Quit smoking](/tags/smoking/) - This one was one hell of a tougher one. Failed a lot of times, lied, broke promises and what not! I think I have succeeded in this very much. ~~The proof? If I put together all the times I smoked, it wouldn't equal one cigarette in entire this year(almost 8 months).~~ As of 2018, It has been years since I smoked!

1. [Run](/tags/run/) a 5K, 10K and a marathon - [5K is done](/tags/5k/). [Unofficial 10K is also done](/blog/the-lost-track-on-the-streets-of-Milwaukee/), but it will stay on the list to do.

1. Go scuba diving

1. Bungee/Base jumping

1. [Sky Diving](/tags/skydive/) - Done!

1. Fire Walking

1. Ride the roller coasters - this one is off the list. Thanks to my [Cedar Point and Niagara trip](/tags/cedar-point/).

1. Learn roller blades - uh, this was a so much [fun and pain](/blog/i-tried-roller-blading/). Tried once.

1. Go dirt biking -

1. Go karting - this one might seem a little odd on this list, but I wanted to do and have already done this. Go karting is fun.

1. Race a sports car -

1. Ride Harley Davidson motorcycle -

1. Go to Himalaya and cut loose all connection with my world ~~for a month at least.~~

1. Visit the Pyramids of Giza.

1. Visit [Tiger’s Nest Monastery](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tiger%E2%80%99s+Nest+Monastery) - Paro Valley, Bhutan

1. Visit [Angkor Wat](https://www.google.com/search?q=Angkor+Wat)

1. Visit at least one of the seven wonder's of the world - Taj Mahal seems the easiest!

1. Learn to play any music instrument - guitar was the one for a long time and then turned to drums, but don't know both!

1. Swim with the dolphins

1. Motorcycle trip to Leh, Ladakh

1. Solve a Rubik's cube - [This one is so off the list](/tags/rubiks-cube/). I can solve it using the ~~lamest and~~ most basic method under 2 minutes. The best being 69 seconds.

1. Learn how to juggle balls - Never really tried as it seems easier!

1. Learn to Ski - This one is also off the list. [Read more](/tags/ski/).

1. Play one full good tennis match - (2010) I have started playing recently and am playing with the tennis club from work for last one month or so. I can't serve right, I can't return the ball properly, blah blah blah.....

1. Play start to finish in 8 ball(pool) - I was so close once that I had only one damned black ball left.

1. Learn two more languages - I had Telugu and Tulu on the list but somehow it didn't take off. Btw, I already know Kannada, Hindi, English, Tamil, Hindi and can read/write in first four of those. I can understand a bit of Marathi (because it's similar to Konkani), Telugu, Tulu in that order of decreasing proficiency.

1. Learn to write with the left hand - I practiced for 10-15 days and then I stopped.

1. Learn to dance - Ok, this is also one of the toughest. I did join Salsa classes, a freestyle class for sometime. I still am very shy! I get bloody conscious. I have danced on stage once in 2010 :-)  I so want to learn Salsa. [More](/tags/dance/).

1. Watch all of top 250 IMDB movies - This is fun. I didn't mention the top movie names because the IMDB list keeps changing. What will I do if I give all 250 names and complete watching all of them? :P

1. Buy a DSLR and click some great shots - I can afford to buy one now, but will I use it or will it be a waste of money? I don't know. (2018) I did buy a camera a while ago. I'm not that good at it! If I ever post them here, it will tagged [photography](/tags/photography/).

1. Learn to talk just as clearly and spontaneously with utter strangers just the way I do with some of my closest - I somehow go nuts and end up talking to the point! I mostly respond with yes, no, hmmm or nods and don't hold a conversation. (2018) I'm mostly over it now I think.

1. Write applications/software that will help people, that everyone appreciates.

1. Make a lot of money and donate excess -

1. Get a tattoo - I don't have an exact idea of what I want yet!

1. Be Humble - This is a everyday activity. It's tough.

1. Raise my little baby girl ♥ - well, she doesn't exist anywhere except in my imagination at times! How can I write anything about it when just a thought of her makes my heart melt away....

1. Adopt a child - a boy or a girl? Depends on my first kid!

1. Apologize to a couple of people!!! One of them was when I was a kid, may be 7 or 8 year old, but I still remember exactly what I did! I did try with one other person; I was completely out of touch and tried to contact another, but I never got a response! This is so hard! (2018) I did apologize to two of them. I think I will let the bygones by bygones and not beat a dead horse. If life ever presents a chance, I will surely take it.

1. Be able to see without specs or contacts.

1. Serve in Indian Army/military someday.

1. Be alive to see the corruption free India - At least to some extent? [Pretty please](/tags/corruption/).

1. ...

1. Die. Subtle recursion, or is it?
