To keep matters simple, just use the RSS feed in your favorite feed reader. If you don't use one, you may use Google's FeedBurner or IFTTT applet to receive an email (as long as those services offer that feature!).


Link to RSS feeds: https://praveenlobo.com/index.xml


#### FeedBurner:

<form style="border:1px solid #ccc;padding:3px;text-align:center;" action="https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify" method="post" target="popupwindow" onsubmit="window.open('https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=lobopraveen', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=550,height=520');return true"><p>Enter your email address:</p><p><input type="text" style="width:140px" name="email"/></p><input type="hidden" value="lobopraveen" name="uri"/><input type="hidden" name="loc" value="en_US"/><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" /><p>Delivered by <a href="https://feedburner.google.com" target="_blank">FeedBurner by Google</a></p></form>


#### If This Then That (IFTTT):

[RSS feed to Email](https://ifttt.com/applets/147561p-rss-feed-to-email) applet. You might be able to find other IFTTT applets to filter based on keywords etc. Google your needs!

Use https://praveenlobo.com/index.xml for RSS feed URL in the applet.


#### Subscribe to specific category or a tag:

You may also subscribe to specific [categories](/categories) or [tags](/tags). Click on the category/tag you would like to subscribe to and append index.xml to the URL to get the RSS feed. Keep in mind that you will have to do this for each category/tag you would like to subscribe to.

For e.g. RSS feed for tech category ("1") will be https://praveenlobo.com/categories/1/index.xml
