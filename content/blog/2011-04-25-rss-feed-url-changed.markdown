Dear readers,

Though there are only a few of you and I'm very sure you are very capable of finding it out yourselves, I think I must save your time and tell you that I'm moving my RSS Feed address.

The idea is simple:

1. I post this post and then  
1. change my RSS feed address.  

So that, assuming you miss this post, in case you wonder why you are not finding any new unread items in Lobo's blog feed, this is the post you find on the old feed and you know the answer. I have moved!

So, what should you do? Just go to my [subscribe](/subscribe/) page and you will find options to subscribe to all posts, only technical posts, or only non-technical posts through feed readers, or via emails.

Any questions? Just leave me a comment below.

Ciao and thank you!
