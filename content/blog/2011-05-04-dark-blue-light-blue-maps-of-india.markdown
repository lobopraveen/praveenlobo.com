These are the India maps I created* when designing [my homepage for the grand 2011 Cricket World Cup](/blog/2011-world-cup-men-in-blue-will-rock-the-world/).

I had a tough time searching for a blue map of India online and ended up creating them myself. With this post they are released online; you are free to use them as you may wish. However, a link to this blog is really appreciated (which I'm sure none of you are going to do! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: )
