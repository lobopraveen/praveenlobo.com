[CORRUPTION IN INDIA](/index_archive/index_004.html)

Will Jan Lokpal bill solve the issue? I don't know for sure, but it will definitely set us on the right path by giving more power to those who matter. It's heartening to see India united to fight against the corruption. If an old man [Anna Hazare] can do so much, why can't the youth do more? If you can, **PLEASE SHOW YOUR SUPPORT** in any way possible. Spread the word.

Just watch this video after 8:00, I bet it will inspire any Indian.

_Edit_: I seem to have lost the link to the video during one of my blog migration.
