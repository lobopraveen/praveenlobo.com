[HotLinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_linking). If you don't know what it means follow the link and spend a couple of minutes reading about it. For those who are not interested in doing so - hotlinking is somebody else riding your superbike on your petrol without your knowledge and without giving you any credit. Bad analogy? :o)

How do you make sure you don't allow something which you don't even know is happening? Very simple, using [.htaccess file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Htaccess) - a directory level configuration file. I'm not going to tell you what you have to put in that file; there are innumerable tutorials on the net - just search for "hotlink prevention".

If anybody uses any image hosted on my website (praveenlobo.com), this is the image that gets displayed - my first GIMP creation!

Created in 2007 - I have lost the original, I could find only this thumbnail. It is good enough for bandwidth thieves, isn't it?
