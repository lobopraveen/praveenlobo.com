Just when I started to laugh at people who were scaring me about the winter, mother nature made sure I shut up. It was a total pain to walk 6 blocks back home from office today! The main problem is the wind. If it isn't for the wind chill factor, the winter is not much of a problem.

It's getting freaking cold here in Milwaukee; it's expected to hit -8°F(-22°C) tomorrow and with the wind and other factors, it's expected to feel like -27°F(-32°C). To say the least, that sucks!

However, Milwaukee is _heating_ up for the Sunday's game. Green Bay Packers vs. Chicago Bears in playoffs for the first time since 1941! It has been declared has the official 'Team Spirit day' tomorrow at office wherein employees are allowed to wear the team jerseys/T-shirts/apparels, even if it isn't Packers.

I went to a local shop here to [buy a Packer’s T-shirt](http://amzn.to/2G1rQX3) and guess what, sold out! Hope Packers kick some Bears ass. :smiley:
