My dear fellow Indians and everyone,

Remember 1983 Prudential world cup? Remember Captain Kapil Dev's greatest catch that dethroned King Viv? No? Neither do I!  It's been 28 years since our captain lifted the cricket world cup. Not just me, nearly 50% of the current Indian population wasn't even born back then!

More than a billion hearts and one shared dream, to see the men in blue lift the 2011 cricket world cup. Will it come true this time? Let us hope so.

Cheers,  
Proud to be one in a billion!
