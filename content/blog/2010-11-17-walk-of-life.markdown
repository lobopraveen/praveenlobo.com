This morning on my way to office I saw an old couple walking across the street. The gentleman was walking at a-couple-inches-a-step pace and the lady, it seemed like, was moving only an inch with every single step. They were crossing a relatively free street and he was holding her hands and leading her. They crossed the street and then turned left to cross another one. A few cars stopped in front of them. Finally, they crossed the street and reached diagonally opposite side of the junction from where they started.

All of this took at least a couple of minutes. I, with a melting heart, stood there watching them and wondered, ‘Towards the end of my journey, will I...?’
