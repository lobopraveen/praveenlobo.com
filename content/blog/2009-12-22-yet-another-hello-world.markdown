I'm bored of [Hello, world!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program); I did that over


  * 9000 days
  * 1300  weeks
  * 200,000  hours
  * 13,000,000  minutes
  * 750,000,000 seconds


ago. Yeah, about 25 years ago, I did my personal _Hello, world!_


> Hello, world!


Yet another "Hello, world!"? Yes, this time not from me but from this very blog you are reading! **_:o)_**

On a serious note, I'm very happy to start this blog, it was one of the items pending on my [Bucket List](/bucket-list) for a long time now. Keep watching this space for the list!
