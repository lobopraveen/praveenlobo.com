On a Friday's evening, eight of us set out to Devil's Lake State Park, Wisconsin in two cars. We reached when it was dark and setup three tents in two camps. The rain god was happy and decided  not to play spoilsport; it poured only when we were in the tent.

We setup campfire, prepared dinner. Made s'more in the campfire for the first time; I had no clue what s'more was!

The next day morning we went hiking on some small trails.

There it was the famous Devil's Doorway.

We walked some distance enjoying the scenic beauty. Clearly I was on the wrong side at the right time. :grinning:

The Balanced Rock trail led us to, well, the Balanced Rock.

From there we went to the other side of the lake. The going down part was great. Three of us didn't take the trail; we came straight down the pile of rock, jumping on the big boulders, climbing down the difficult ones. We didn't race but it was almost like racing down to reach the railway track.

We played volleyball, mock-kabbadi. No one was ready to swim in the Devil's lake. Partly because it was cold and also most of us were tired. I didn't miss the chance; two of us swam in the lake for sometime.

We then followed the railway tracks to come back to the tents. Oh, we did get to see the train!

By night fall we were back. Again, we setup campfire, prepared dinner, celebrated by firing some crackers. Each of shared some interesting stories from our past. This is when Rahul and Kusuma announced their wedding plans.

It rained again that night. We packed up the next morning and returned to Milwaukee.  BTW, this is the first time I met Jon who later became a good friend of mine. We were constantly talking while going up and we missed an exit; we had to drive nearly 20+ miles to find the next exit and drove all the way back while others were waiting for us in one of the gas stations.

This was one of the memorable trips - although I've been trekking before, I'd never put up a tent before let alone sleeping in the tent and then the s'more, great time with friends, memories...
