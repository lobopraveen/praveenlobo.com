It was that time of the year again when the pumpkins are carved, people get costumed, and walk around downtown, of course, showing off. Guess what I did different this time - I carved a pumpkin! The family I was with loves cars so I thought of carving a Mustang (they own one). I made a sketch of it from a picture I had taken of their car, but decided not to do it as it'd be difficult and was probably going to take more time. I left the sketch at home and when I reached there, I didn't know what to carve other than a smiley face. So, I just decided to go for the Mustang carving with the sketch out of my mind. It didn't turn out to be a Mustang not even close, but it looks like a car at least. See them below. Oh, that's them driving the car. :smile:

It was the second Halloween and guess what I became this time? [Anonymous!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_%28group%29). Though all of them mistook me for Vendetta and just like last year, some recanted, 'Remember, remember the fifth of November...'

Anonymous was in news all year round and I thought it'd be appropriate for me to be an anonymous this time. I didn't have to do a lot; like a true IT guy, I just [_reused_](/blog/halloween-2010/) the mask from last year.  I love that mask and don't be surprised if I wear it next year too!

> Remember, remember today is the fifth of November.
