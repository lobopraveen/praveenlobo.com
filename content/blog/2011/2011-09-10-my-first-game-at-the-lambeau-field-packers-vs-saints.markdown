[As I mentioned earlier](/blog/a-visit-to-the-frozen-tundra-lambeau-field/), I was able to get the tickets for the opening game of the season on September 8th, 2011. The world champions take on the New Orleans Saints. We also managed to make some time to visit the hall of fame. One thing I learned during this visit was the super bowl ring is not given just to the players but also to coaches, trainers, executives, personnel, and general staff! The winning team can present the rings to whomever they choose.

This was the first football game I ever watched in a stadium and there was no better place to witness the Packers play. Green Bay was totally packed with Packer fans and a dozen of Saints fans as you can imagine. I have been to a game of Cricket between Royal Challengers Bangalore versus Kolkata Knight Riders and have seen a huge turn out before, but this was a different experience altogether. People tailgating, 99% of them wearing team jerseys or apparels, music concert by Kid Rock, Lady Antebellum, and Maroon 5, the two stunts, and most of all the majority of the fans supported one team - the Green Bay Packers. And the Packers didn't fail to deliver. It was a high scoring game and Packers won 42-34. Highlight of the game was Randall Cobb's touchdown, a 108-yard kickoff return that tied the longest touchdown return in NFL history.
