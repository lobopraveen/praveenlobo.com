The next day as planned we drove to Niagara falls. There were a lot of people; I could see a lot of Indians as well. You probably won't believe me but I met my a friend from my college (India) with his friends on Goat Island, I had no clue he was also visiting. Then I met another friend of mine from Bangalore on the Observation Tower! My friends were right when they said be prepared to see the place full of _desis_.

We first went to Terrapin Point, Goat Island. Thundering water, dense mist raising up in the sky, it was beautiful. Goat Island divides the Niagara River and lies in the middle of Niagara Falls between the Bridal Veil Falls and Horseshoe Falls.

The entire falls is divided into American and Canadian (Horseshoe) falls based on border. Canadian falls falls between Terrapin Point (US) and Table Rock (Canada).

We then went to Bridal Veil Falls, Niagara Falls Observation Tower and from there we went went to Maid of The Mist.

It is a boat tour that takes you directly into the dense mist of spray inside the curve of the Horseshoe Falls. You will be covered in plastic ponchos so that you can enjoy the view without getting completely wet. It was difficult even to open eyes completely but it was amazing to get so close to the falls. The sheer volume of the water pouring downwards left us speechless.

From there, we went to the Cave of Winds which surprisingly doesn't have caves anymore! The caves are destroyed due to a rockfall in 1950s. The elevator took us down to the river level and then we walked right up to the base of the Bridal Veil Falls with water thundering down on us. Even though the water hit us so hard that we couldn't stand properly, I didn't feel like coming back from there. It's amazing.

Make sure to cover up all you cellphones etc. in waterproof bags before going there or better yet take turns and have someone safe-keep it. Most importantly, make sure your pants are tight and don't wash down. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

We headed back to Observation Tower to watch the lighting of the falls. We had quite a wait there and it was getting colder and heavy winds just worsened the condition. However, it was worth the wait. The falls looked so lovely. This is a must watch. Then we had dinner in Top of The Falls restaurant there and caught a glimpse of the fireworks - it was a great view.

Then it was the inevitable - head back to the hotel, catch a flight, get back home thing.

Notice how many times I used amazing, that's because it indeed is. Put this with adrenaline pumping Cedar Point and you have an ultimate long weekend getaway. Take my words for it - it's will be one of your best trips.
