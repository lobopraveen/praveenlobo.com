You know by now. Indians are the world champions! Yeah, say that again, WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS!

Remember "More than a billion hearts and one shared dream"? That's what I [wrote](/blog/2011-world-cup-men-in-blue-will-rock-the-world/) when the world cup started. That dream has come true! Now more than 50% of Indian population can proudly say they saw their captain lift the world cup at least once in their life. Glory!

#### Homepage mania:
I dedicated the [homepage](/index_archive/index_002.html) to Green Bay Packers and they won the super bowl; they are the Champions!

I dedicated  the [homepage](/index_archive/index_003.html) to Indian cricket team and they won the world cup; they are the CHAMPIONS!!!

Now, am I gonna pull a hat-trick in this?


#### Food Art?
My roommates and I prepared dosas just before the super bowl championship game and  the world cup cricket finals match. Did the dosas do the trick? Food wins everyone over so...
