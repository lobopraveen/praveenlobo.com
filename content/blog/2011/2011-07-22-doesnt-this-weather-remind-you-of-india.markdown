The weather has been truly devastating this summer (Milwaukee 2011).  National Weather Service issued heat advisory; many sources reminding the deadly heat from 1995 and 1988 which took a lot of lives! The weather forecasts, news-sites, and other sources of information on the internet are terrifying.

##### Rewind to 2010
I landed exactly one year ago in Milwaukee. The weather was not bad. It compared to the weather I was used to in Bangalore. I didn't notice much difference at all. Move forward to Fall, I was being constantly warned about the winter ahead! I kept hearing this for a long time as the winter arrived very late.

When I was a kid, I used to think that the seasons are all made up! I could never clearly distinguish between the seasons; they all looked nearly the same except the monsoon (because it rains :smirk: ) I hardly remember people getting prepared for the summer or winter except buying sweaters for December. Milwaukee was different. For a first timer, being prepared was the key. It was the coldest I had ever been exposed to. So much so that once I called moving to Milwaukee as 'walking into the refrigerator' Now when I look back, I don't think it was as bad as I expected it to be; however, I, just like everyone else, was wishing for the summer.

##### Forward to summer 2011
Where was the summer hiding? It was cold for a long time and no summer in sight. Many joked, 'this time around there is no summer; it's gonna be winter next!' How I wish it was true!!! Now that it's here, I don't think there's one sane person who likes it. I, for one, completely detest it. It's so terrible that I have never been exposed to such worse weather. Then people ask me - 'isn't this just like India?', 'come on, this is better than India' etc.

>"doesn't this weather remind you of India?"

>"Yes sir, absolutely! This harsh weather reminds me how wonderful the weather in Bangalore was."

Hope the heat waves die down soon. Stay fluid.
