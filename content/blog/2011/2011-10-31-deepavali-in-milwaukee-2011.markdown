My second Deepavali in Milwaukee. Celebrated by visiting temple, doing a small pooja at home and then at a friend’s place. Prepared gulab jamun, had lot of wonderful food at potluck in friend’s place. Concluded it with firecrackers.

My roommates kept American dollars next to Indian rupees on the alter. I wonder what they were praying for. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
