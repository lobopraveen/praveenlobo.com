#### Cedar Point, Sandusky, Ohio, United States.

During the long weekend of September 2010, I visited Cedar Point and Niagara falls along with three other friends. It was an awesome trip. We took a flight from Milwaukee to Cleveland Ohio and rented a car from airport for the entire trip. The plan was to go to Cedar Point one day, visit Niagara next day, and head back the day after.

First we drove to Cedar Point (Sandusky Ohio) from Marriott (Cleveland Airport Marriott). It was already noon by the time we reached there. It looked a bit scary from outside. All those roller coasters, best in America rankings, and *never-before-sat-in-a-roller-coaster* feeling. Once we were inside there were huge lines near all coasters and rides. It was obvious that we would not be able to cover all of it especially because my friend and I wanted to sit at the very front in all rides that we take that day. So, we decided to hit the best of Cedar Point.

First up was  Millennium Force, the number 1 roller coaster of 2010 and in top 2 places since it was opened in 2000. I wasn't scared until the last 2-3 minutes or so. A lady waiting for the 2nd row got to know that this was my first roller coaster ride and she started scaring the hell out of me. She had been there a couple of times but never dared to sit front and that was the first time on the 2nd row for her.

> "You are a brave man. Don't shit in your pants", she said!

When the coaster started and going up inch by inch, my heart was beating faster. I could hear the screams from other  riders. I was almost on the verge of calling it a mistake when it stopped for a moment at the top. We didn't have any time to savor the beautiful Lake Erie on the left, all we were worried about was the 300 feet fall at 80 freaking degrees*. In the end, it was mind blowing! I wanted to do it again!

**Never ever miss such a ride and when you are there, just stop thinking and get to the very first row. You will thank me for the advice.**

These are some other rides we took:

- Corkscrew  
- Gemini  
- Blue Streak  
- Magnum XL-200  
- Mantis  
- Maverick  
- Mean Streak  
- Top Thrill Dragster  

We missed Raptor. If you are visiting then just make sure you look up for the extremes and don't miss it. (Check [Google image search](https://www.google.com/search?q=cedar+point+roller+coasters))

I can't close this episode without mentioning the fastest and the second tallest ride - Top Thrill Dragster. 120mph (190km/h) is enough to get the idea. We had a slow start - in fact, even the slowest snail would have over taken us during the initial pick-up! Then it just stopped and didn't move for may be 5 minutes and there I was in the front row with my friend. It was kind of awkward! But when it did start, it went vroooom! It was so fast that I couldn't get my hands up in the air, I felt my cheeks trembling and getting dragged backwards due to the force. Then the approximately 90 degree raise and fall. Crazy!

We had dinner there and then finished it off with Wicked Twister and maXair before heading back to Marriott. ([to be contd.](/blog/niagara-falls-and-cedar-point-trip-day-2))
