My day at work had just began, when I overheard a colleague of mine talking about rule number two. He is very senior to me and is dangerously intelligent! I couldn't stop myself from asking him what the rule number two was.


"Hey, what is rule number two?", I asked.

"Well, do you know rule number one?", he questioned.

I replied, "Nope", thinking why didn't I ask about rule number one first!

With a smile he said, "Rule number one - know what the hell you are doing. Rule number two - if something goes wrong, always find someone else to blame."

Then walking towards his cubicle he announced, "and there's a third rule, take all the credit."

The smart man had proved himself again!
