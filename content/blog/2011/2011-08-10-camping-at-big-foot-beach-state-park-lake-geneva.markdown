Another summer, another camping. This time at [Big Foot Beach State Park, Lake Geneva](http://maps.google.com/maps?client=ubuntu&channel=cs&ie=UTF8&q=Big+Foot+State+Park,+Lake+Geneva&fb=1&gl=us&hq=Big+Foot+State+Park,&hnear=0x880584e9f85c4509:0x9eb9a6efc12afe43,Lake+Geneva,+WI&cid=0,0,7166353873496965653&ll=42.574321,-88.438568&spn=0.126411,0.343323&z=11&source=embed). It is located very close to the lake and is right in the city. Four of us camped from Friday evening to Sunday morning with two friends visting Saturday night.

We had a wonderful time. Setting up the camp, the fire, the food, the conversations, a walk, the trails, swimming in the lake made the camping trip a nice one. We also went on a boat tour in Lake Geneva which is a must for anyone going there. The minuses - a lot of insects (bug spray is a must) and the campsites are smaller and are very close to each other.

Btw, I got an eye infection after the trip; mostly due to swimming in lake without goggles and touching eyes with hands cleaned with tap water without any soap!
