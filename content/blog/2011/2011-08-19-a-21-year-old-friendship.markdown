Krishnamurthy. He is my oldest friend. We were in same class in Bangalore for six years starting 1990 before I had to leave. We were not in touch and had not met more than a handful of times in the last fifteen years. Then when I met him, he was still the same! He had moved to a new place and before I knew it, he was gone from there. I tried to find him but in vain.

Then the Orkut and other social networking thing happened and I got in touch with him again. He was in RVCE pursuing his bachelors in Computer Science and I was in PESIT running after a degree in Information Science! Though these two colleges were just 5KM apart, the communication between us was extremely rare! Neither of us had a cell phone I believe.

Then all of a sudden, he asks for my number and says he is in Chicago! This dude was in Chicago! I met him once in Chicago and had him come over to Milwaukee last weekend. It was great meeting my oldest friend.
