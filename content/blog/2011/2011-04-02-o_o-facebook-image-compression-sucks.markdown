Facebook [profile picture] image compression not only sucks big time, but it is also stupid. I don't use Facebook as an image storage service, neither do I care about the EXIF data that they strip. I'm also okay with their approach to compress each and every image(?), but compressing an image which results in an image size bigger than the originally uploaded image? I think it fits in my O_ops series.

Both images are of JPEG format and 378 x 377 pixels; the original is 17.0 KB (17429 bytes) and the compressed is 18.3 KB (18757 bytes) which is like 7% increase in the file size. The worst part is that it looks like shit!
