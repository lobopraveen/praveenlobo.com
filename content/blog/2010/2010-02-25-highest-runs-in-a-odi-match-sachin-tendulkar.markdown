I have come across a lot of comments, communications, posts, and people (even my Dad and Bro) where they mention how they hated a Pakistani cricketer(Saeed Anwar) holding the record for highest ODI runs in a match. I don't understand! A cricketer is a cricketer, a game is a game, a record is a record, what does it have to do with the citizenship?

What would you(esp. Indians) have called Sachin, if he was a Pakistani? A devil? **_=P_**

PS - I was at work during the match; I missed it. **_:o(_**
