Dear blog, as you know, uh oh you don't, do you? I never mentioned about it! I'm in US right now. The very fact that I haven't mentioned it till now shows how busy I'm here! Naah, not really, that's what I say when I turn lazy and forget about you. I won't promise you that I won't again; I can't keep such promises. Sorry!

Anyway, this is kind of new. Different lifestyles. Cultures. New friends. Work environment. Schedules. Meetings. Food. Currency. Everything. To some extent, I'm leading a different kind of a life which I don't exactly prefer but don't mind trying for some more time.

The reason I came here is to tell you about Halloween. There have been numerous events after I landed in US which I plan to tell you later when I catch hold of some photos, may be briefly .

I bet, I didn't know about Halloween until recently. I didn't have any clue until this Saturday afternoon that I will be wearing any costume as part of Halloween at all. It's when these friends of mine started buying costumes, it hit me that I should also try something. That's all. I became V - V for Vendetta.

We went to Water Street here in Milwaukee. It was really nice. A lot of people recognized on the way. Some were shouting V. A couple of them appreciated the costume. Best part was when a girl recited 'Remember, Remember the fifth of November. The gunpowder treason....'

Cool eh? I bet. It was fun too. It was really amazing to see everyone in Halloween spirit. My friends were also dressed up very cool. See for yourself. Before that, here, a cool dialog from the movie.

V :: I can assure you I mean you no harm.  
Evey :: Who are you?  
V :: Who? Who is but the form following the function of what and what I am is a man in a mask.  
Evey :: Well I can see that.  
V :: Of course you can. I'm not questioning your powers of observation I'm merely remarking upon the paradox of asking a masked man who he is.  
Evey :: Oh. Right.
