Very first impression(within a minute of installing):

> WTF, it hung!

I had kept `/home` on a separate partition for the first time and wanted to check if it works fine for all users. I created an account and set the home folder as `/home/irine` and then hit save - switch user - log off - WTF!

Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) is impressive; thanks to all those who made it possible _:o)_

PS: `/home` on a separate partition works like a charm.
