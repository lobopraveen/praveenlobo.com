Uruguay vs. Ghana
Quarter final match - 2010 FIFA World Cup

I was sleepy, but somehow this match seemed too good to miss. I had to wash my face with cold water to stay awake. I must tell you, it was WORTH it. Much much more than WORTH it. An exciting match. Last few moments I had my heart in my mouth. I wasn't supporting any of the teams, but still I feel heartbroken; Ghana should have won. Unfair.

Finally Luis Suarez did it. It was The Hands of God. If it wasn't for these Hands, Uruguay was surely going out of the world cup. It gave them a hope, a chance to come back and oh boy, they didn't miss it. For the Uruguayans Luis Suarez is a hero!
