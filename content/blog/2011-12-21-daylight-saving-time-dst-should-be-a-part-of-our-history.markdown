I was having a conversation with a friend of mine who is convinced that the Daylight Saving Time (DST) change is good and makes perfect sense. I, for one, think that the DST is not useful anymore and it could have been avoided altogether. Just imagine if we didn’t have clocks and a way to time. We would have adjusted our lifestyles automatically to adapt to the nature. Instead of adjusting the clock, we should have adjusted the schedules.

The idea of DST was to save energy and people more social time, but the technology and the lifestyles have changed. The definition of _social_ itself has changed. With the advanced technology compared to the time when DST was first introduced, the problem with forgetting to spring forward and fall back, the pain it causes to the programmers who deal with the date and time functions, the global workforces and so on, I completely oppose DST.

DST is so last century that it should be a part of history. Definitely not present.

If you think, I could have explained more about DST, don’t worry, someone else already has. Check out the video below. Don’t miss it after 4:30 into the video.
