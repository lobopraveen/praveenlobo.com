I don't know whether to be happy or doubtful when a stranger walks up to me in the gym and

{{% convo %}}
Stranger:: Hey
Me:: Hi
Stranger::You are regular here?
Me::(have you ever seen me here earlier?) No. Second day in this gym.
Stranger::Oh okay.
Me::Why?
Stranger::You have got a good physique dude. (smiles)
Me::Aha, thanks buddy! (flees the scene)
{{% /convo %}}

This has happened a couple of times before; back then it was my friends/acquaintances and I knew I deserved it! :o)Â  But now? Gentleman, you are either trying to motivate me or hitting on me!

The truth is that I'm so out of shape that when I met my previous gym coach a couple of months after I stopped going to his gym, looking at my arms he said, "It looks like polio-stricken chicken's leg."

Yep, I signed up to a gym.
