Edited to include changes made in 2020. I don\u0026rsquo;t build locally anymore so the script is basically unused; however, I did update it to make it slightly better. The Travis script has been updated to make it generic. Only the environment variables need to be changed if anyone else decides to use it.\n After migrating the blog to Hugo and making some custom changes, it was time to develop the CI-CD pipeline. The key objectives for my CI-CD pipeline were\n to be able to build the site locally and to be able to build the site remotely on a CI server  Build Locally More often than not, I use my computer to post stuff on this site. As I already have the site repo and Hugo on my machine, I run the hugo server --buildDrafts while editing the repo with a browser window open on my secondary monitor to monitor the edits. This is the simplest no nonsense editor setup I use.\nI wanted to be able to build the whole site locally when I have everything I need already. It didn\u0026rsquo;t make much sense to push the changes to GitHub and have Travis-CI handle the build and publish part. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any tests and sanity checks built on the CI server anyway.\nI built the following script to automate the build and deployment activities. This lets me choose between a local or a remote build.\n#!/bin/bash ############################################### # Function to git add all commit push (gaacp) # ############################################### gaacp() { echo \u0026#34;Updating local repo with latest files...\u0026#34; git add -A git commit -m \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then echo \u0026#34;ERROR: Local repo commit failed.\u0026#34; exit 1 fi echo \u0026#34;Pushing the updated repo to GitHub...\u0026#34; git push origin master if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then echo \u0026#34;ERROR: git push failed.\u0026#34; exit 1 fi } # End Function if [[ $# -ne 1 ]]; then echo -e \u0026#34;ERROR: Missing parameter. \\nUsage: $0\\\u0026#34;commit message\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; exit 1 fi echo \u0026#34;Pulling latest repo from GitHub...\u0026#34; git pull origin master if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then echo \u0026#34;ERROR: Repo pull failed.\u0026#34; exit 1 fi read -p \u0026#34;Do you want to build the site locally? y/n: \u0026#34; localbuild if [[ $localbuild = \u0026#34;y\u0026#34; || $localbuild = \u0026#34;Y\u0026#34; ]]; then echo \u0026#34;Local build selected.\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Present working directory: \u0026#34; `pwd` echo \u0026#34;Cleaning up publish directory...\u0026#34; find docs -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 ! -name media -exec rm -rf {} \\; echo \u0026#34;Hugo version: \u0026#34; `hugo version` echo \u0026#34;Building Hugo site locally...\u0026#34; hugo if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then echo \u0026#34;ERROR: Site build failed.\u0026#34; exit 1 fi gaacp \u0026#34;$1[skip ci]\u0026#34; elif [[ $localbuild = \u0026#34;n\u0026#34; || $localbuild = \u0026#34;N\u0026#34; ]]; then echo \u0026#34;Remote build selected.\u0026#34; gaacp \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Please remember to pull the latest from the remote repo once the remote build deploys the site.\u0026#34; else echo \u0026#34;ERROR: Incorrect input supplied.\u0026#34; exit 1 fi Notice the git pull at the very beginning. It is added so that the local code is updated with any changes or updates made from other workspaces or remote builds.\nIf a remote build is requested, this script gives out a message to pull the changes, if need be. I don\u0026rsquo;t pull the changes separately as this script pulls it anyway.\nThe [skip ci] text in the Git commit message notifies Travis to ignore the check-in.\nBuild Remotely For the times when I don\u0026rsquo;t have access to my computer but still wanted to update the site, I setup the CI-CD pipeline. This allows me to post from virtually anywhere, any device as long as I can connect and commit to GitHub repo. GitHub\u0026rsquo;s markdown preview acts as a basic WYSIWYG editor except that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand Hugo\u0026rsquo;s shortcodes which honestly is not a big inconvenience.\nSetting this up at a high level was as easy as -\n Creating deploy keys for the repo so that Travis can deploy the built site. The public key goes in GitHub and the private key goes to Travis. Encrypting the private key so it remains secret and only Travis can decrypt it. This needs travis gems installed and of course, Ruby as well. Building the steps that Travis will take whenever it finds a commit to the repo.  The travis.yml is shown below.

Apparently, even calendar has a slick way of doing this! Although the algorithm I outline works, the implementation suffers from the same limitations as the original java.util.date or calendar implementation.\n I came across a post asking the last Friday question a long time ago and found the answer (also shown below) quiet interesting.\npublic Date getLastFriday( int month, int year ) { Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance(); cal.set( year, month + 1, 1 ); cal.add( Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, -( cal.get( Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK ) % 7 + 1 ) ); return cal.getTime(); } I wanted to see if this can be generalized to work for any day like last Sunday or last Wednesday etc.\nThe main part of the logic is in calculating the number of days to subtract:\n( cal.get( Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK ) % 7 + 1 ); //for Friday This was missing a critical piece if this had to be flexible to accept any day of the week. After working out a number of examples, I derived the inconspicuously named magic number which turns out to be zero for Friday!\n// Calendar.FRIDAY is 6 int lobosMagicNumber = (13 - Calendar.FRIDAY) % 7; // equals 0 Here is a the worksheet:\n(read: when the first day of the NEXT month is Sunday, we need to subtract 7 to get the last Sunday of the month. 6 to get the last Monday and so on.)\n Get Last Any Day of The Month\n   Here is the implementation:\n/** * Returns the date of the last specified \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;day\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; of the month. * * @param date * a date for which the last specified \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;day\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; of the * month has to be determined * @param day * any day of the week * * \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; * Example: lastDayOfMonth(date, Calendar.SUNDAY) returns last * Sunday of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;date\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; * * @return the date of the last specified \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;day\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; of the month. * */ public final static Date lastDayOfMonth(Date date, int day) { Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance(); cal.setTime(date); // set calendar to the first day of the next month \tcal.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1); cal.add(Calendar.MONTH, 1); // calculate the number of days to subtract to get the last desired day of the month \tint lobosMagicNumber = (13 - day) % 7; cal.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, -(((lobosMagicNumber + cal.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK)) % 7) + 1)); return cal.getTime(); } I have published the code on GitHub which is mirrored on GitLab to use GitLab-CI.

My answer has been the same, \u0026ldquo;I use a tool I wrote.\u0026rdquo; followed by, \u0026ldquo;I will send you a link. You can use it from there or just make a copy of your own.\u0026rdquo;\nI remember myself asking that question to others when I first started the job in mid 2000s. Most of my seniors liked to store the links in excel or a word document as we were not allowed to use any browser other than the Internet Explorer (IE) and the bookmarks in IE weren\u0026rsquo;t searchable. No tools were allowed either. This was, and in some cases still is, a common thing at workplaces in enterprises.\nAfter a couple of months of trying different options, I ended up using an HTML page which was another common thing to use. We would set the HTML page as home page and just do Control+F to search for links! Some people used HTML pages with different sections and it got fancier. There were a lot of different ways depending on who you asked.\n Bookmark Search\n   If you guessed it, I didn\u0026rsquo;t shy away in creating my own bookmark tool either; however, I\u0026rsquo;m proud of it and use it even to this day! My version took the HTML page one step further by adding an input box and some JavaScript to search. The initial version was written in vanilla JavaScript and it would fire a search function onkeyup which would delete all rows from the table and add new rows that matched the input typed. On escape, it would redirect to the intranet search site with the text entered as search query.\nI re-wrote the HTML using jQuery and the autocomplete widget a couple of years after that and added position method to center the input box. I used some answers from StackOverflow to implement search on multiple words. After that the only change I did, other than adding the new links, was to update the jQuery version while publishing it now.\nChrome\u0026rsquo;s bookmark manager I use chrome://bookmarks/ for personal use as I have maybe two or so dozens of links only. As you can see in that screenshot above, I really like saving bookmarks without names on the bookmarks bar. Why do I use Chrome\u0026rsquo;s bookmark manager?\n Adding and removing bookmarks is easy. Search - unlike the tool, Chrome\u0026rsquo;s search looks in the URLs as well. This is not difficult to implement in but I never really felt the need to do it. If you do, submit a pull request! Sync - all my bookmarks are in sync across devices and operating systems.  Why use bookmark tool over Chrome\u0026rsquo;s?  Sync - Chrome\u0026rsquo;s sync feature is a plus for personal use and a minus for work. Saving work bookmarks in Chrome would lead to information leak. Also, like many people, I only use one device for work so there is no need for sync. Cross browser sync and compatibility - a lot of enterprises still have applications that work only on IE! Using static HTML page that works in all browsers basically amounts to syncing between the browsers! Chrome opens file locations inside browser and IE opens them in Windows Explorer! Collaboration - all team members can use the same shared HTML page - I use a desktop shortcut to the shared page. A set of small published guidelines will help keep it consistent in terms of keywords. Usability - keyword highlighting, escape to search, and key-up/key-down to select a link is not available in Chrome\u0026rsquo;s bookmark manager.  This bookmark tool can be implemented on an intranet site or a website easily too. The list of keywords+URL pairs (and even the code itself) can be obtained from the server on onfocus event and the list could be customized on the backend based on the user.\nThis has saved me a lot of hours over the years and hope it helps you save some as well.

It creates a single version of the truth in a consistent, transparent and fully audited environment. Firms benefit from greater control, ongoing compliance and transparency of their data.\n Markit has it\u0026rsquo;s own product for Enterprise Data Management called Markit EDM. I have fairly decent exposure to this tool including passing Markit\u0026rsquo;s core introduction and advanced course. Any MEDM person worth their salt would agree that the Data Matcher is the heart of the MEDM. It is also one of the complicated components that is daunting and gets out of hand easily at which point no one wants to touch it! I had limited experience with the matcher as it was already setup by the time I came on board the project and it was being managed by a few other people. This whole post is about my hands-on with the Data Matcher to gain more experience with the component.\nPlease note that the entire thing below was carelessly jotted down which I cleaned up after a year or so. You might find a lot of case mismatches, abbreviations, and even some random sentences where it really didn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense to me. I\u0026rsquo;m not trying to make it 100% accurate but just documenting it as is so that if I ever get a hold of an MEDM instance I can follow along. If you are currently working in MEDM, this might make a whole lot of sense to you!\nWarning: Markit introduced a replacement for the Data Matcher called the Core Matcher in their 11.x release. It is much faster, less cumbersome, and easier to manage. This page is not about the Core Matcher; you probably don\u0026rsquo;t even want to read this junk!\nAbbreviations  ZX - is a prefix I used just so I can sort the objects easily towards the bottom in the list. ZXMCHR - Code for Matcher - MCHR with ZX prefix BB - Bloomberg PNT - Point BRS - BlackRock  Observations I listed down the observations shown below as I was going through the setup and different scenarios as described in the post below starting from the Setup. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense now, come back after going though the whole thing.\n  Each matcher gets CADIS.DM_ZXMCHR_INBOX, CADIS.DM_ZXMCHR_KEYS, CADIS.DM_ZXMCHR_SEARCH views. Inbox views are created for individual sources as well.\n  Each source gets CADIS.DM_ZXMCHR_ZXSOURCE_INFO, CADIS.DM_ZXMCHR_ZXSOURCE_INFOALL, CADIS.DM_ZXMCHR_ZXSOURCE_OUT views.\n  CADIS_PROC gets the main tables - DM_MATCHPOINTx and DM_MP4_SOURCExxx where x is a digit.\n  CADIS data matcher views store all columns from the source even if the columns are unchecked in the rule columns stage\n  Added master table as reference input without any rules and no data shows up in the CADIS DM INFO, INFOALL, OUT views.\n  CADIS DM_*CODE*_KEYS view (match point keys) has the CADIS ID, obsolete, and exists? column for each source and changed by.\n  The exists column was true even after the row was deleted from the source but false after running the matcher.\n  DM_*CODE*_SEARCH shows acceptor\u0026rsquo;s name in the last modified column! It removes the row if the input row is deleted without even running the matcher.\n  All other places show data matcher if you accept its proposal. If you change the proposal then it shows your name.\n  Each source gets some random number and MEDM creates CADIS_PROD schema \u0026gt; DM_\u0026hellip; tables with that number. It gives keys and revisions.\n  Revision table is where the key is stored even when the source record is deleted when not asked (unchecked) to remove CADIS ID association. If it is checked then it deletes it from revision table also hence a new CADIS ID if it comes back again.\n  Setup for hands on  4 sources. 1 master table. Master is not required as input source usually. Three others sources are BB, BRS, and PNT. Master table - zxMasterSMF (AssetID, bbgid, cusip, BRScusip, pointid, isin, country, currency) master table has CADIS ID called AssetID and keys for each source i.e. bbgid, BRScusip, and pointid. reference input dups not allowed but appear in inbox include CADIS revision re-present manual overrides generate all possible matches. BB table - zxbbsmf (bbgid, cusip, isin, country, currency) normal input dups not allowed but appear in inbox def will not show in inbox pass to matcher if subsequent run results in a different match include CADIS revision , re-present manual overrides, generate all possible matches. BRS table - zxbrssmf (brscusip, isin, country, currency) normal input dups not allowed but appear in inbox def will show in inbox pass to matcher if subsequent run results in diff match include CADIS revision re-present manual overrides generate all possible matches PNT table - zxPointSMF (Pointid, cusip, isin, country, currency) normal input dups allowed pass to matcher if subsequent run results in diff match include CADIS revision if a record is no longer present remove associate with assigned CADIS id Uncheck everything not needed in match rules in the rule columns.  Rules  master has no rules BB bbgid on master at 100% BRS threshold set to 75 brscusip on master at 100% BRScusip to bb cusip + isins at 90 just isin on bb at 80 rule type insert 76% if country is russia rule type dedup on brscusip PNT threshold set to 70 pointid on master at 100% cusip + isin on bb at 70% just cusip or isin match on bb at 65  Day 1 Think of the INSERT statements into BB, BRS, and PNT tables as the incoming records from that source that has been validated already.\ninsert into zxbbsmf (bbgid, cusip, isin, country, currency) values (\u0026#39;bb1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;cusip1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;isin1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;us\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;usd\u0026#39;) (\u0026#39;bb2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;cusip2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;isin2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;us\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;usd\u0026#39;) Default 1000 \u0026amp; 1001. 0 confidence.\nI wanted it to start at 1001.

Then reran to start at 1001.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say we take matcher output and master the data. The inserts into the master table would look like below.

I usually keep things simple so that future changes are as painless as possible, however, I decided to go ahead with these changes as it improved maintainability and reverting these changes are very straight forward.\nHugo\u0026rsquo;s default publish directory Hugo generates the static site content in public directory by default. This worked fine for me when I tried hosting this site on GitHub\u0026rsquo;s master and gh-pages branches. The only problem was that the actual source code and the generated content were in two repositories and that is one more than what I wanted to maintain. Using a submodule approach worked fine, but I think it complicates the setup unnecessarily and is easy to mess up.\nI wanted to keep it simple and all in one place and that\u0026rsquo;s around the same time GitHub announced publishing from docs directory. Exactly what I wanted and at the right time! Yes, that was 2016 and this post was long overdue!\nI have set Hugo to use docs as the publish directory and set GitHub Pages to publish the site from docs directory on the master branch.\npublishdir = \u0026quot;docs\u0026quot; Theme as a regular directory Instead of setting up the theme using Git\u0026rsquo;s submodule, I just keep the theme as a regular directory to avoid using submodule. I make sure to watch the theme repo on GitHub so that I get notified about any changes to the theme. I then decide when to get the latest changes.\nAnother reason for doing this is sometimes I find it easier to edit the theme a little to make it work for me. Editing the source files from another repo is something to avoid as it makes upgrading difficult, but this was an easy way out. Hugo does provide a way to override the theme with layouts; however, I haven\u0026rsquo;t really put anytime into making it work that way.\nContent organization I had about 125 content files directly under content\\blog\\ neatly ordered YYYY-MM-DD due to filename and it got old really quick. It was annoying when I was trying to look for something or add a new post. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine maintaining a huge site with a lot of files this way - doable but not my style. I broke down the blog directory into sub-directories based on the year the post was published. The content is now easier to handle.\nWhen the content is moved to different directories, the URLs of the content files change based on where the content file is located. To avoid the URL change, I defined where the content should be shown using the slug variable in the front matter.\nAfter the reorganization, all I had to do was search and replace all occurrences of slug = \u0026quot; with slug = \u0026quot;../. This worked as I wanted the URL to remain the same as before and wanted to remove the additional /YYYY/ due to the re-org. This can be achieved using the url variable as well.\nNote that I had to do this because I don\u0026rsquo;t use the permalinks variable in the Hugo config. My content files are named YYYY-MM-DD-\u0026lt;file/title name\u0026gt; from WordPress extraction and I already had some posts whose URL didn\u0026rsquo;t match the filename so I was already using slugs to keep URLs clean.\nI did break down the media directory similar to content files but they are ordered just by numerals. This was a breeze thanks to pattern matching and back-referencing in regex find and replace.\nDe-duplicating the media In my site repo, I had the media (images, video, audio etc.) in two places. One under static/media and the other under the published directory docs/media. The total size of media in my case is around 1MB which is just fine but this could be a problem if the size of the media directory is huge as the size would be doubled.\nTo de-duplicate the media on the Hugo site repository, I came up with the following strategy.\n Place the media directory in the Hugo recommended static directory. Create a .gitignore file to ignore static/media/ directory so that this never gets added to the repo. Build Hugo site. The media directory gets copied from static directory to the publish directory docs  This approach came with caveats - if I was cloning the repository, I would have only one copy in the docs directory which meant the hugo server command would not render any media. Worse yet, my build step that cleared the publish directory used to remove the only copy of the media. Even if I fixed the build step and I would have to copy the media directory to the static directory right after a clone.\nI came up with another approach described below and this is my preferred approach.\n Place the media directory in the Hugo\u0026rsquo;s publish directory docs Use the mounts module to mount the directory. This goes in the config file.  [module] [[module.mounts]] source = \u0026#34;docs/media\u0026#34; target = \u0026#34;static/media\u0026#34; Update the clean-up script to retain the media in the publish directory\n$ find docs -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 ! -name media -exec rm -rf {} \\;  Earlier version of this approach used symlinks instead of the mounts module. It worked well even though Hugo threw Symbolic links for directories not supported error; Hugo used to ignore/skip the symlinks while building the site which is what I wanted as the media was already in the publish directory. Some Hugo version after 0.62.2 broke the symlink setup with Error: Error copying static files: symlinks not allowed in this filesystem error. See issue #74\nAll these customizations are visible on the GitHub repository of this site.\n","href":"/blog/hugo-static-site-on-github-customizations/","title":"Hugo Static Site on GitHub - Customizations"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/blog/","title":"blog"},{"content":"I have been telling myself that I will get back into blogging again and again in vain.

Anyway, I getting slightly off-topic.\nI have had this website on a paid shared server for a number of years. Although I never faced any issue with the hosting provider, I did realize I was wasting money on them when I could just use a static site and use one of the many free hosting services. After a little research I settle on Hugo as the static site generator and GitHub Pages as the host. GitHub made sense for this site as the traffic volume is low to non-existent lately and it allows to host the site directly from the repository. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to describe the process step by step here. There are numerous tutorials available already.\nThis whole process at a high level -\n install Hugo pick a Hugo theme - they come with an example sites setup up the folder structure and move all migrated markdowns to contents folder run hugo and copy the contents from publishdir to GitHub update repository settings so that GitHub publishes the site  I did try out a few different ways of publishing a site using GitHub Pages. They have good documentation which was a big help. I finally picked the Project Pages sites as it fit my needs better.\nConverting the WordPress site to static site and making it run smoothly was really a pain. I followed the recommended tools for migration and made a list of issues/enhancements that I noticed. I think the major issues I faced moving from WordPress to Hugo are -\n  Comments - Static sites don\u0026rsquo;t have built in commenting system. I ended up migrating the comments to disqus but the site was not showing comments on many posts as the WordPress to markdown conversion had altered some URLs which disqus uses as key. I have since fixed the URLs; however, I\u0026rsquo;m still not very comfortable with using a third party commenting system.\n  Media links - I had used WordPress short codes for images and the converter didn\u0026rsquo;t understand the WordPress shortcodes and broke almost all media links. I fixed this and I also rearranged the media folder.\n  Code snippets were broken - I ended up moving the code snippets AS-IS to GitHub. I provided a link to GitHub as well as used Hugo\u0026rsquo;s highlight short-code on this site.\n  Search option - I had Google Custom Search on this blog before but to keep things simple, I\u0026rsquo;m settling with a direct Google search link\n  Missing Google AdSense - this is not a Hugo problem. Themes should support this. My current theme doesn\u0026rsquo;t support Adsense by default; however, it does allow custom JS files. I included the Adsense code in the custom JS. I used to make just enough money from this site to pay for the webhost but that ad money has long gone! I did add a review page with Amazon referral links - check it out.\n  I\u0026rsquo;m working on some more customizations. Hope to write some more on it soon.\n","href":"/blog/from-wordpress-to-a-static-site-generator/","title":"From WordPress to A Static Site Generator"},{"content":"Over time the twitter feed just fills up.

He mentioned that the issue with query he was dealing with was sporadic and doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen in all environments. That sounded interesting. I asked him to pull up a chair so we can go over it together.\nThe problem was with a query that used to run fine for a long time and started failing a couple of weeks ago. This had caused manual work for his team each time it failed. The error was with some conversion he said.\nMsg 8114, Level 16, State 5, Line 1 Error converting data type nvarchar to bigint. This was on going for a while until one more query started fail. This time the error message had a little more clue and this is when it was taken seriously.\nMsg 245, Level 16, State 1, Line 1 Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value \u0026#39;ABC\u0026#39; to data type int. I asked him the obvious - did you make sure you are not comparing a string to an integer? He showed me each and every column in the query along with all the possible values. There was no string to integer business. The query was something like this.\nWITH ReportKey AS ( SELECT RKey FROM dbo.fnGetKeysForReport(param1, param2) ) SELECT Column1, Column2 FROM TableName T INNER JOIN ReportKey K ON K.RKey = T.SomeKey He had listed all possible values for param1, param2, RKey, SomeKey. He had also ran the dbo.fnGetKeysForReport() function for all of the possible params and it never failed.\nAfter a brief discussion about the query optimizer, query execution plans, inline table values functions etc. I pointed out that the K.RKey = T.SomeKey was the problem. His assumption was that the common table expression (CTE) would execute first and the resulting RKey would always be an integer as all combination of params to the function always returned integers. This was incorrect; the query optimizer had other plans. In one of the error messages, the value \u0026lsquo;ABC\u0026rsquo; was mentioned. When we went to the actual table where RKey was stored, the very first row on that table had the value \u0026lsquo;ABC\u0026rsquo; so it was clear what the query optimizer was trying to do.\nThe query optimizer had decided to expand the inline table valued function to bring in all possible values of RKey from the underlying table first and was trying to store the values as integers as the column it was being compared against was of type integer. Key thing here was that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t applying any WHERE clause from that function yet and hence the conversion error.\nIt is a good idea to use the accurate data type while storing the data. Using nvarchar as it allows to store other types such as integer is a bad design. In this case, the usage was reasonable and at this point it wasn\u0026rsquo;t feasible to redesign the whole thing. I offered him two options -\n Update the LHS of the expression to make sure the value is always an integer to avoid the conversion error. Update the RHS of the expression to make sure the value is always nvarchar to avoid the need for conversion.  We picked option 1 as the underlying problem was with RKey (RHS side of the expression) and it conveyed a subtle message to the future reader that this value needs conversion. When the value was not numeric, we used -1 as T.SomeKey can never be -1. Of course, we added comments explaining why the conversion was needed.\nINNER JOIN ReportKey K ON IIF(ISNUMERIC(K.RKey) = 1, K.RKey, -1) = T.SomeKey  Why did the query fail only in one environment? That too after working fine for so long?\n There was some recent change to the query and it was promoted to higher environment. When we looked at the failures, it started occurring exactly the day the change was promoted. Ditto with the second query as well. The recent changes had forced the optimizer to redo the execution plan and the one picked was different than the previous one leading to the conversion error. The same queries were running fine in the lower environment as the optimizer was picking a different execution plan.\nThe important thing to remember is that the way we write the query is not necessarily the same way the optimizer decides to run it. Also, write the query to make it easy for humans to understand and leave it to the optimizer to pick the best way to execute it.\n_All posts with backdated post tag are published long after they were written._\n","href":"/blog/sql-error-converting-the-data-type/","title":"SQL Error Converting The Data Type"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/amazon/","title":"Amazon"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/referral/","title":"referral"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/reviews/","title":"reviews"},{"content":"This is a list of items I have bought from Amazon that I don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to recommend.\nAmazon Bestseller links\n         [Dell Ultrasharp LED Monitor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NZTKOQI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1\u0026linkCode=ll1\u0026tag=lobpra06-20\u0026linkId=900f6b2576505c836f2b86787399f6bd\u0026language=en_US)|[Canon Lens EF 50mm f/1.8 STM Lens](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-STM-Lens/dp/B00X8MRBCW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8\u0026psc=1\u0026refRID=4904Z9F42KRFPTSX51ZX\u0026linkCode=ll1\u0026tag=lobpra06-20\u0026linkId=8ab0622fb2f12778b6e5eae63c620fdc\u0026language=en_US)|[Nest Learning Thermostat](https://www.amazon.com/Nest-Learning-Thermostat-Generation-Stainless/dp/B0131RG6VK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8\u0026psc=1\u0026refRID=TR3HPRAR9KZ3S12T7M5G\u0026linkCode=ll1\u0026tag=lobpra06-20\u0026linkId=4314ea42a1daafd35f2285c2662d54aa\u0026language=en_US)| [Epson WorkForce WF-3520 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0091UBCB6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1\u0026linkCode=ll1\u0026tag=lobpra06-20\u0026linkId=a2f2d9425d243407872aa4f3379f5c2e\u0026language=en_US)|[Brother HL-L2340DW Compact Laser Printer](https://www.amazon.com/Brother-HL-L2340DW-Monochrome-Wireless-Replenishment/dp/B00LZS5EEI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8\u0026psc=1\u0026refRID=4BN473A5TDR0QWJRKBT3\u0026linkCode=ll1\u0026tag=lobpra06-20\u0026linkId=13c76dfd64c7d032b139d57d1d870f8a\u0026language=en_US)|[Yongnuo YN-568EX II Flash](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DA8459G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1\u0026linkCode=ll1\u0026tag=lobpra06-20\u0026linkId=48e49fb568b25880b0a956fcb79cf7e6\u0026language=en_US)|[Cordless Hand Vaccum](https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-CHV1410L-Lithium-Cordless/dp/B006LXOJC0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?\u0026linkCode=ll1\u0026tag=lobpra06-20\u0026linkId=ee9d8eec6d4b066464ee64bf91754a64\u0026language=en_US)| [Duracell Procell AA 24 Pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009V2QX/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1\u0026linkCode=ll1\u0026tag=lobpra06-20\u0026linkId=26369723ac0f5388f69d6eefe6d59cfb\u0026language=en_US)|[AA High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries with charger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FJBDVIM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026th=1\u0026linkCode=ll1\u0026tag=lobpra06-20\u0026linkId=7e5ad47bf6b59f917e4fb598116bfbf8\u0026language=en_US)|[Panasonic Eneloop Rechargeable Batteries with charger](hhttps://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-K-KJ17M3A4BA-Battery-Rechargeable-Batteries/dp/B00JHKSMJU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8\u0026refRID=74HQZAHYJDDAB6SFX2ZT\u0026th=1\u0026linkCode=ll1\u0026tag=lobpra06-20\u0026linkId=6fc10c9293ddb2f49b233129312dcb1f\u0026language=en_US)| [Samsung 850 EVO 1TB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-2-5-Inch-Internal-MZ-75E500B-AM/dp/B00OBRFFAS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=pc\u0026ie=UTF8\u0026qid=1508990849\u0026sr=1-1\u0026th=1\u0026linkCode=ll1\u0026tag=lobpra06-20\u0026linkId=42d33151861c6c7143dcdc62d64bbeb8\u0026language=en_US)|[D-FantiX Moyu Aolong V2 Rubik Cube](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R12NJOE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1\u0026linkCode=ll1\u0026tag=lobpra06-20\u0026linkId=b8d91ce97ea08e7f5d471b0c5d76acfb\u0026language=en_US)|[Dayan ZhanChi Rubik Cube](https://www.amazon.com/Dayan-ZhanChi-3x3x3-6-Color-Stickerless/dp/B008U6V50U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=toys-and-games\u0026ie=UTF8\u0026qid=1508989961\u0026sr=1-2\u0026keywords=dayan+zhanchi\u0026linkCode=ll1\u0026tag=lobpra06-20\u0026linkId=cca752a4b03ae275b67aa9a19bc2a89b\u0026language=en_US)|  [Combination Smoke \u0026 Carbon Monoxide Alarm with Voice \u0026 wireless interconnect](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVO7C2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1\u0026linkCode=ll1\u0026tag=lobpra06-20\u0026linkId=7cbc9acbaf59ddc7888771674d530ad3\u0026language=en_US)|[First Alert Heavy Duty Plus Fire Extinguisher -

When it comes to US, a dominant force in the world, any political change impacts nearly every part of the globe, and it is important that we, the rest of the world, know how the elections work!\nFrom my short reading it appears that, contrary to my beliefs, the people do not elect the president directly! Yes, they do not! There is a concept of pledged, unpledged/uncommitted, and super delegates (with some variation between the Democrat and the Republican party). Depending on the state, people either participate in a caucus or a primary to elect the delegates to represent them at their party\u0026rsquo;s convention. In a caucus, the delegates are chosen directly based on the their preference of a candidate. In a primary, people vote for their preferred candidate or delegate or both on the ballot. The way in which the state delegates are assigned to the candidates depends on whether it is a winner-take-all or a proportional method employed by the state and/or the party! All of these rules differ from one state to another!\nThen the conventions take place where the elected delegates from all the states choose a nominee. In most of the states, the Republican rules bind the pledged delegates to vote for the winners from the primaries they represent in the first ballot, first only, at the convention. As highly unlikely it may seem, these rule can be changed before the convention! On the Democrat side, the delegates are not bound at all! Almost always, the conventions will pick the candidate with the majority of delegates from the primaries/caucuses as their nominee because in not doing so, they betray the people that voted for such a majority.\nAfter all this drama, comes the election day where the people vote, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean anything! Even though the people vote for their candidate, they are technically voting for their electors, and the winning electors in turn vote for the president!!! There are laws in 29 states that the electors can only elect the candidate they have pledged. Only in two states, the stray votes are void. These are the state laws that can be changed by the states! Though there has never been a case where the faithless electors changed the outcome of the entire election, it is certainly a possibility! The election of 1836 is an example where the faithless electors prevented Richard Johnson from vice presidency; however, due to a lack of majority, he was elected by the senate as the vice president. If nobody has the majority, at least 270, of electoral votes, the House gets to vote among the top three candidates and elect a president. All this convoluted process may have been designed to prevent a Trump like situation!\nNote: This article, just like every other major news, assumes that Hillary will be the nominee. But Bernie is my choice, and I hope that he wins the nomination.\nAs the election day gets closer and closer, Trump is holding on to the majority and it is certainly possible that he ends up with the majority of delegates! Who would have thought?! If this happens, he will have to be the nominee unless the rules are changed before the convention. Even if the rules are changed, this will be very undemocratic of the Republican party! If he doesn\u0026rsquo;t get a majority of 1,237 delegates, which looks unlikely, and decides to take it to the conventions, it may be very difficult for Trump to run as an independent after that due to all the regulations and the deadlines, but still doable with a lot of money! In such a scenario, he would want to get on the ballot wherever possible to take votes away from the Republican nominee. This would ensure that the Democrats win!\nRepublican leadership wants to make sure that Trump will not be the president from their party, but still wants to win this election. Trump\u0026rsquo;s victory will have a long lasting negative impact on their party and they will not let it happen. The best case for them is Trump without majority delegates. If that doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen, there is a way out - a moderate Republican running as an independent! A moderate that could bring the frustrated Republicans that are staying away from the ballot back on the election day to take enough votes away from Hillary and Trump to ensure nobody gets a majority. By doing so the House gets to vote among the top three candidates and it is almost certain that they will pick the independent they backed. If this is their approach, they are running out of time as the deadlines are approaching fast!\nOn the Democrat side, Hillary and Bernie are too close; however, Hillary is the establishment\u0026rsquo;s choice and will most likely be the party\u0026rsquo;s nominee if the current numbers hold up! The chances of Bernie running an as independent is diminishing as each day passes because of the same reasons mentioned above! He has also announced that he will not be running as an independent candidate if Hillary is the party\u0026rsquo;s nominee so as to make sure he will not split the Democrat votes which will benefit the Republicans tremendously. However, Trump factor wasn\u0026rsquo;t in play at that time of Bernie\u0026rsquo;s announcement, and having Bernie in the mix would have definitely blocked a majority for the Democrats.\nThe situation has changed now. If there is an independent in the run that could take a few electoral votes away from Hillary and Trump, nobody will get a majority. If this possible threesome pans out, Bernie might as well jump in the party however highly unlikely it may seem! This makes it impossible to have a clear majority; if the independent backed by the Republicans doesn\u0026rsquo;t end up in the top three, the house will either have to choose between Hillary, Trump, and Bernie or go without anyone. If it is the latter, the vice president-elect will act as the president until a president is elected. If vice president-elect isn\u0026rsquo;t available, speaker of the house, Paul Ryan, will act as the president until a president and a vice president are elected.\nThis scene is about to get very dirty!\n","href":"/blog/us-presidential-election-2016-trump-card/","title":"US Presidential Elections"},{"content":"HOLY MOTHER OF SWEET BABY CORN!

This can be extended to add a search functionality to search and bring in the XML before running the comparison.\nSearch File: To get a matching line from a file, use VBA code as shown here on the gists repo I maintain. Or just use power query as shown below and place the result in the XML cell. Note that the power query returns all matching lines as opposed to the aforementioned VBA code which returns the first occurrence. The VBA code can be edited to return multiple lines if needed.\nlet KeySource = Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name=\u0026#34;SearchKeys\u0026#34;]}[Content], KeysWithoutNull = Table.SelectRows(KeySource, each [Keys] \u0026lt;\u0026gt; null), DistinctKeyList = List.Distinct(KeysWithoutNull[Keys]), TxtFileData = Table.FromColumns({Lines.FromBinary(File.Contents(\u0026#34;File_Location_here\u0026#34;))}), FilteredRows = Table.SelectRows(TxtFileData, each List.AnyTrue(List.Transform(DistinctKeyList, (substring) =\u0026gt; Text.Contains([Column1], substring)))), MatchingLines = Table.RenameColumns(FilteredRows,{{\u0026#34;Column1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Lines From File\u0026#34;}}) in MatchingLines The code assumes that the key to search is in a table named \u0026ldquo;SearchKeys\u0026rdquo;.\nSearch Database: Power query makes like easy to run a query against a database.\nlet KeySource = Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name=\u0026#34;SearchKeys\u0026#34;]}[Content], KeysWithoutNull = Table.SelectRows(KeySource, each [Keys] \u0026lt;\u0026gt; null), DistinctKeyList = List.Distinct(KeysWithoutNull[Keys]), OneLiner = List.Accumulate(DistinctKeyList,\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,(state,current)=\u0026gt;if state = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; then \u0026#34;\u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026amp; Text.From(current)\u0026amp;\u0026#34;\u0026#39;\u0026#34; else state \u0026amp; \u0026#34;,\u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026amp; Text.From(current) \u0026amp;\u0026#34;\u0026#39;\u0026#34; ), DBData = Sql.Database(\u0026#34;server\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;db\u0026#34;, [Query=\u0026#34;SELECT * FROM dbo.tablename WHERE somecolumn IN (\u0026#34;\u0026amp; OneLiner \u0026amp;\u0026#34;)\u0026#34;]) in DBData Using the snippets shown above XML strings to compare can be brought in to the spreadsheet before running the comparison. This way an XML string from a file can be compared to another one from a different file or even a database.\nComparing multiple XML strings: The VBA code from previous post talked about comparing a single XML. That same code can be put in a loop to compare multiple XML strings. The use case below lists a set of keys for which the matching XML strings from a file needs to be compared to matching XML strings from a database.\n Compare multiple XML strings\n   The \u0026ldquo;SearchKeys\u0026rdquo; mentioned above is a table and can take multiple rows/keys. There are three keys in the screenshot shown above (refer column A).\n The \u0026ldquo;Search File\u0026rdquo; can be assigned to a macro that refreshes the connection for the file search power query from above. The result of the power query should go to the \u0026ldquo;file\u0026rdquo; sheet.  ThisWorkbook.Connections(\u0026#34;Query - FileSearch\u0026#34;).Refresh  The \u0026ldquo;Search DB\u0026rdquo; can run the database search power query and load the \u0026ldquo;database\u0026rdquo; sheet.

The function searches the key column by passing the text from key column xml.Offset(0, -1).Text to the InStr function.\n\u0026#39; \u0026#39; MIT License \u0026#39; \u0026#39; Copyright (c) 2018 Praveen Lobo (praveenlobo.com) \u0026#39; \u0026#39; Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy \u0026#39; of this software and associated documentation files (the \u0026#34;Software\u0026#34;), to deal \u0026#39; in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights \u0026#39; to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell \u0026#39; copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is \u0026#39; furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: \u0026#39; \u0026#39; The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all \u0026#39; copies or substantial portions of the Software. \u0026#39; \u0026#39; THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u0026#34;AS IS\u0026#34;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR \u0026#39; IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, \u0026#39; FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

We have a couple of weeks of summer left in 2012 and I don’t want to waste that spending more time on blogging. Lately, I have been feeling like blogging is a winter activity (not saying that I blog regularly in winter). There are a number of topics blog about but no time. I keep adding topics to the todo list and keep deleting when I revisit because it’s either too late or it is making the list too big. This has been my story for past year or so. I can’t sit down and just do it. Maybe I should fix a schedule and stick to it. I don’t know.\n  At work - Lately, I have been working a lot. Like never before. Last week was nearly 80 hour week. I shouldn’t be working so much; at least not in the summer.\n  On the road - This May I had been on my first road trip first real road trip. Unforgettable. You will see a post about a road trip to South Dakota soon. 😄\n  On the ground - I have been playing tennis once a week. Joining a club has made sure that I play at least once a week! Other than that I have been running a few 5K. It’s tough to get up and run everyday or practice, I just register and run. This summer I have completed 5K at Rock ‘n Sole 2012, Storm the Bastille 5K fun run 2012, 5K at the Roots and Wings arranged by Northwestern Mutual, a 5K and a 6.5K at the gym a few days ago.\n  On water - Been swimming on and off this summer as well. I, along with a few friends, have purchased sailing lessons. I have completed one class and looking forward to the rest. I spent the first class on the sailboat wondering about the sailboat movement more than anything. It was pretty interesting to just visualize the forces acting on the boat.\n  In air - Nothing yet. Sometimes I feel like just going for the skydiving A license, but can\u0026rsquo;t decide if I really want to. Also, to keep it current, I\u0026rsquo;d have to jump in winter months and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t sounds that enticing.\n  What next? - I’m participating in the Milwaukee Color Run this Friday with a group of friends with a team I created - CountMeIn! It should be fun and I’m looking forward to it. There is also a plan to go to the Apostle Island soon. I want to go sea kayaking if I go there.

I just jumped right in and started riding the bike two or three blocks from the start line!\nAfter a mile or so into the ride, I started noticing the bibs on all riders and they all read, ‘25 mile ride!’ I thought of returning to the start line for the 12-mile ride, but I took it as a challenge to stay on and ride 25-mile!\nWhat did I miss? One, the start line and two, the Hoan bridge! Kinda sucks, doesn’t it?\nMistakes? Not having enough sleep, not stretching before the ride, skipping breakfast, not stopping at any stations to grab a snack or a energy drink. Sometimes stupidity takes over common sense. Around 5-mile to the finish line, my calf muscles gave up. Thankfully, the last station was just a few blocks away. I stopped for a while and grabbed 2 granola bars and a gatorade.

I had sold my first bicycle and didn\u0026rsquo;t have one to ride.

I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to ride a bike until I was thirteen or fourteen I think. My mom was too scared to allow me to ride a bicycle. I\u0026rsquo;d lie to mom and go trying to ride a bike instead of playing. I can\u0026rsquo;t remember anyone helping me how to ride. I somehow learnt by borrowing/renting bicycles on my own. We could rent bicycles from cycle shops for one or two rupees for an hour and as soon as I collected enough money, I\u0026rsquo;d run the cycle shops, rent a bike. It was indeed liberating to just bike away and explore the part of the villages that I had never seen before.\nMy dad gifted me a bicycle when I passed SSLC exam. I still remember going with him to the bicycle shop, picking up a bike and riding it back home. I was happy that I got a bicycle more than I was happy that I cleared the exam! It was a brown Hercules MTB for around 1,700 rupees - no gears, just the basic bicycle.\nIt became my primary mode of transportation during pre-university college, early morning tuitions, and countless small trips around the town. It was my darling. I modified it by adding 4 or 5 gears, cut down the handle length, threw away the mud guards and rear carrier, changed the tires (I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I added a short diameter front wheel for a while), and the last but most famous modification was by wrapping black solution tape around spokes to make it look like 3 plastic spokes per wheel. That look was very cool and it was copied by many kids within a few days. I was so proud!\nI never wanted to sell it, but once I started working and moved out of Bangalore it started rusting. I kept it for another three years or so before mom convinced me to sell it. I decided I\u0026rsquo;d rather have someone ride it than let it rust. One fine day it was sold.\nI still miss my first bicycle - a gift from my dad. I wish I had at least one picture of it to post here. Every time I think of that bicycle, it reminds me that my dad kept his promise; it reminds me how happy it made me. More than anything it makes me proud of my parents who provided us what they didn\u0026rsquo;t get themselves.

I wish they just get rid of it. It’d be helpful; however, the programmers will still have to deal with the timezones. I was answering questions related to the timers on this website and I keep getting a lot of questions on DST and the timezones. Even though it seems easy, this topic is very confusing. There are lot many sources on the Internet and reading them confuses the hell out of me.\nTo avoid conflicts when dealing with the transactions from many different timezones, it is essential to normalize the dates and by normalizing I mean converting it to UTC. Let me take an example in JavaScript.\nLet the date in question be in Indian Standard Time (IST) January 02, 2012 22:00:00 GMT+0530\nHow to convert the date into a local time(CST)? var now = new Date(\u0026#34;January 02, 2012 22:00:00 GMT+0530\u0026#34;); /* now = Mon Jan 02 2012 10:30:00 GMT-0600 (CST) */  How to convert a date to UTC? This is where many of the online sources go wrong. The simple answer is to convert the date into milliseconds since Epoch and add the timezone offset and convert it back to a date object. Simple? No, this is partially correct. When the calculated milliseconds are converted back to a date, you get a local date.\nvar nowUtc = new Date( now.getTime() + (now.getTimezoneOffset() * 60000)); /* nowUtc = Mon Jan 02 2012 16:30:00 GMT-0600 (CST) */  Notice the GMT-0600 (CST) part at the end. That means the resulting date is not GMT, it is CST. If you convert this date to GMT it will read - Mon Jan 02 2012 22:30:00 GMT but we want it to be Mon Jan 02 2012 16:30:00 GMT\nThere is also another incorrect way mentioned all over the Internet -\nvar nowUtc = new Date(now.getUTCFullYear(), now.getUTCMonth(), now.getUTCDate(), now.getUTCHours(), now.getUTCMinutes(), now.getUTCSeconds());  The result will be no different than the one that you see above.\nHow to convert the local date to UTC date? now.toUTCString() /* now = Mon, 02 Jan 2012 16:30:00 GMT */  How to get the local date from the UTC date? now = new Date(now.toUTCString()); /* now = Mon Jan 02 2012 10:30:00 GMT-0600 (CST) */  That is a long string to store, is there any alternative to store the UTC time? Just store the number of milliseconds since Epoch converted to UTC by adding the timezone offset.\nvar millis = now.getTime() + (now.getTimezoneOffset() * 60000) /* millis = 1325543400000 */  How to convert the milliseconds in UTC to local date? Subtract the timezone offset.\nnow.setTime(millis - (now.getTimezoneOffset() * 60000)) /* now = Mon Jan 02 2012 10:30:00 GMT-0600 (CST) */  The code from above is used in this demo page.

I, for one, think that the DST is not useful anymore and it could have been avoided altogether. Just imagine if we didn’t have clocks and a way to time. We would have adjusted our lifestyles automatically to adapt to the nature. Instead of adjusting the clock, we should have adjusted the schedules.\nThe idea of DST was to save energy and people more social time, but the technology and the lifestyles have changed. The definition of social itself has changed. With the advanced technology compared to the time when DST was first introduced, the problem with forgetting to spring forward and fall back, the pain it causes to the programmers who deal with the date and time functions, the global workforces and so on, I completely oppose DST.\nDST is so last century that it should be a part of history. Definitely not present.\nIf you think, I could have explained more about DST, don’t worry, someone else already has. Check out the video below. Don’t miss it after 4:30 into the video.\n  ","href":"/blog/daylight-saving-time-dst-should-be-a-part-of-our-history/","title":"Daylight Saving Time (DST)"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/dst/","title":"dst"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/google/","title":"Google"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/google-voice/","title":"Google Voice"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/mobile/","title":"Mobile"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/voice-mail/","title":"Voice mail"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/voip/","title":"VOIP"},{"content":"From the recent notes I made on the Google Voice and how it uses the carrier minutes and data to operate, it should be free in 2012 and beyond.\nWhy? Currently, Google Voice is not a VOIP service and it uses the carrier minutes and data to operate which means to make or receive calls the subscriber has to pay the carrier. See the image in that post. If Google Voice doesn\u0026rsquo;t offer VOIP service and starts charging for the voice calls, the subscriber will be double charged. For every call made or received, the subscriber has to pay to use Google Voice and then, since Google Voice uses the carrier minutes, has to pay the carrier for using the minutes. If this is exactly how it works, it will be very difficult to justify Google Voice. I\u0026rsquo;d definitely drop Google Voice and, I think, many other will do too.\nCharging for Google Voice makes sense if either Google Voice offers VOIP services (like Skype which uses just data) or if it charges on a monthly basis - an amount for using their services. The free text messages and the call management service are worth paying for, but if it\u0026rsquo;s too pricey, one would rather pay the carrier and get rid of the call management service. Many plans offer unlimited text messaging and the call management service isn\u0026rsquo;t something that one can\u0026rsquo;t live without. Lo and behold, the biggest benefit would be that you won\u0026rsquo;t be providing any more self-data to Google than you already have or are!\nThere are some apps (Talkatone, GrooVe IP etc.) which use VOIP services like Google Talk along with Google Voice and allow for free calls over data. What happens if Google decides to get rid of the free calling service in 2012? Even these third party application will not be able to make free calls. The applications will use only data (and save carrier minutes), but Google Voice will not be free. It will be interesting to see what direction those third party applications take at that time.\nAll this will just be opinions/guesses/rumors, until Google comes out and announces their plan, which should happen not too far from now.\n","href":"/blog/will-google-voice-be-free-in-2012-and-beyond/","title":"Will Google Voice be free in 2012 and beyond?"},{"content":"Does Google Voice Use Minutes or Data? Does Google Voice cost money? How does Google Voice calling or texting work? The answer is Yes, Yes, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nUpdate: See this for more info\nGoogle Voice is an awesome idea and piece of software (if you are willing to give away more self information to Google than you already have). It is not a VOIP service like Google Talk; it is a call management service. It will always cost you money in one way or the other (cellular minutes or data) and you will not be able to make free calls. If you consider cellular data to be free or use wifi, there are workarounds to make it free like using Talkatone or GrooVe IP or other third party apps. These applications use Google Talk free calling feature (VOIP) along with Google Voice, which integrates with Google Talk, to make free calls using only data. Keep in mind that by using more services, you are distributing your own information all over the Internet companies.\nSo. Google by itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow free calls on the cellphones. Google allows free calls on the computer using Google Talk. Third party applications allow free calls on the cellphone using the cellular data and Google Voice + Talk.\nAre text messages free on Google Voice? Yes. Whether you use it from a cellphone or a computer, messages are free.\nHow does Google Voice use your minutes or data to send/make or receive calls/texts? From what I read about it on Google forums, I put together a simple diagram. Notice the color coding in the image.\n  Google Voice and Carrier Minutes or Data\n   Incoming and voicemails Google transfers the call to your cellphone which costs carrier minutes. If you are using Google for voicemail, whenever you miss a call, your carrier forwards the call to Google voicemail. Call forwarding uses carrier minutes.\nOutgoing and voicemails First, if you notice a voicemail and call your voicemail box, you are using carrier minutes. Second, whenever you initiate a outgoing call, Google Voice uses data (a tiny bit) to connect to the server and initiates the call by calling your cellphone, which costs carrier minutes, and then connecting the call to the other phone.\nText message and voicemail Why is voicemail mentioned here? Because Google transcribes the voicemails which can be accessed as email or text messages. Now, all text messaging happens over the cellular data or wifi and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t use any cellular minutes.\nWhy did I say I don\u0026rsquo;t know how Google Voice works? Because I really don\u0026rsquo;t know how it works. I just know how they use the carrier minutes/texts (on high level) and I hope by now you do too. Let me know in the comments below.\nNote about setup:\n Using Google Voice number as primary and transferring calls to your cellphone number. Disabled the carrier voicemail and set it to forward to Google Voice voicemail. Disabled text message forwarding (to cellphone) on Google Voice. Have free calls within US/Canada using Google Voice.

I always wanted to learn rollerblading. A friend of mine forced me to get into it for sometime before giving up on me. But this sweetest day, I gave it a try. It\u0026rsquo;s indoors so there\u0026rsquo;s no danger of getting run over by a truck. How many people might be there for the embarrassment part? I thought may be 10-15, but boy, I was wrong! This place was full of people. People on rollerskates, rollerblades. Zipping through the center.\nI knew I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to do it right then, but I\u0026rsquo;m not a chicken. What\u0026rsquo;s more embarrassing? chickening out seeing some 7 year olds doing it or giving it a shot and rolling next them on the floor, well, literally! I tried; it\u0026rsquo;s been a week and my wrists still hurt. But that\u0026rsquo;s not the point. The point is I was able to do it, albeit, slowly. It was fun and yeah, a little embarrassing. I fell down even before entering the ring. Once there I was ok-ish for a first timer on rollerblades who has never even tried anything that starts with roller other than those that end with coasters. 😉\nThere are some things that one shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do. I mean, one just shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do. Like being on the rollerblades for the first time and going to the rest-rooms to pee with the rollerblades still on. The toilet floors are made of tiles and they slip easily. You know where I\u0026rsquo;m going! I somehow managed to get there but after that was, well, funny. Tried the usual way, but the damned rollerblades gave that back and forth rocking motion, which I\u0026rsquo;m sure would\u0026rsquo;ve ended up on some epic failure or funny video sites if shot. So, I held the water pipe that was running down the ceiling in one hand and tried with the other hand. That didn\u0026rsquo;t work out well either! Thankfully there was no one in there all that time; I zipped out without dirtying the floor or my jeans!\nA couple of more laps, no falls, thumbs up from the guy who watched over people. All went well. I just re-chanted the words that guy told me while I was wearing the rollerblades.\n \u0026ldquo;First time? Uh oh, don\u0026rsquo;t leave that person, just stay next all the time. It\u0026rsquo;s all about the confidence man, you go out there and do it.\u0026rdquo;\n At first I was staring at my feet and soon realized that was wrong when I fell on my ass. I could feel my legs just rolling and then all of a sudden upper body is falling back and is in air. I just put my wrists to the ground before my butt hit the floor. Ouch, that hurt. Learnt a lesson but couldn\u0026rsquo;t avoid the next three falls while all the kids, what it seemed like, going at 50MPH right next to me. Anyway, it was fun. I should do it again, albeit, with the wrist guards.\nAt the end, I was just trying to find a seat to remove the rollerblades and going down the hall. This same confidence-guy saw me from a distant and gave two thumbs-up with a big smile. I should have known better and just continued on my blades instead I twisted a little bit to give him thumbs up and fell really hard still holding the thumbs up.

And it was the cheapest!\n  Light House in Lake Huron\n    Mackinac island\n    Mackinaw bridge\n   Mackinac Island - The drive to St. Ignace was around 6+ hours and there were a lot of pit stops. We played on the beach, passed Bombay Motel, splashed water on each other. It was fun. We dropped our bags in the motel on our way and when we reached St. Ignace it was mid afternoon. We took a ferry that takes people to the island. It’s a nice place on an island with a road which runs around the island.\n  Streets\n   We rented bicycles which had back peddling as brakes! Irksome at first but was okay after getting used. We rode around the island, stopped at many places, took pictures, and before we knew it was already time to catch the last ferry back. I had so much fun riding the bike without holding the handlebars and flapping hands like a bird flying; brought back memories! We also noticed someone’s wedding there; you can wed there too, but it might be really costly. This is a lovely place overall.\n  Bicycle on Mackinac\n   Back to Manistique Motel - Nothing much there. After weighing out dinner option we went to Big Boy restaurant. It had a good buffet. Best option around. They had a currency collection from around the world; the employees there said their boss is very interested, so my friend donated a Indian Currency (a 20 rupee note I think). I’d love it if they actually added it to the collection.\n  Pictured Rocks\n    Shore\n   Pictured Rocks sea kayaking - yay! We were excited, got up ready and reached the Munising on time, but the mother nature had other plans. The kayaking was canceled due to high waves. Nearly 15 feet high wave! It was the main reason we planned the trip and to see it wash away in the high waves was very disappointing.\n  Sand dune\n   Country Road H-58 - After talking to the tourist information center, we decided to go around sight-see. The main hiking trails were closed anyway. We hit H-58. It was unexpected but the drive blew me away. Tall trees along side the narrow road, no median, totally curvy stretch. A beautiful drive during that time of the year.\n  Miners Castle\n   Don’t miss H-58 - Don’t miss it because of the places it takes you. Just look at the map here. We stopped at most of the places. Woodland park, Sable falls, Log slide, Chapel beach, Grand Portal point, Miners castle. One can easily spend a day on this beautiful stretch. Don’t miss the sand dunes and the breath taking view.\n  Sable falls\n   Log Slide - Don’t miss this one. Just go down the slide and come up. Go with friends. I met two 6 year old boys down on the beach and we competed against each other on climbing up. No need to mention, I came last.\nHigh Tide and Low tide - I can’t finish this post without mentioning this. I don’t remember the beach name, but it was like a long stretch and at the one end, back water was connected to the lake (like a foot high water level) and then a small area of sand at the end. We just walked carelessly and within no time the water level started rising, within a split second it rose up to our waist, we managed to get back and thankfully the water level went down. It was a little scary considering the high tides that day.\n  Christmas village\n   Christmas came a little early - Not really, we visited a village called Christmas in Michigan!\nBack to the motel and to Milwaukee - We reached motel at dark, having nothing to do we went straight to bed. We set out to Milwaukee the next day, or did we?\nLambeau Field, Green bay - We had a lot of time on hand, we stopped and played in most of the beaches on our way and decided to visit, lo and behold, The Lambeau Field.\n  Play\n   What did we miss? - Of course, the sea kayaking. We also learned that there was an annual walk on the Mackinac Bridge on the Labor day, but the group was not much interested. Right time, right place, wrong group!\nEven though the planned event went haywire, the unplanned events such as the drive and places around H-58 and the visit to Lambeau Field made the trip worth and memorable. I’m posting this nearly 4 months after the trip and I remember it like yesterday. I’d definitely go up north again to kayak in the sea. Definitely.\nPS: How does Pictured Rocks look in winter?

I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how it will be to fall from 14,000 feet, descending at 120MPH (193KMPH). I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if the instructors will be able to guide me ntil the pull; I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if the parachute will open fine or not; I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if I would land on Interstate-94 and get dragged down the road.\nWhy did I chose to do it then? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I felt I can do it; they won\u0026rsquo;t be stupid enough to let first timers go directly to AFF if it was so dangerous. After watching a couple of YouTube videos of AFF level 1, there was no going back. The ground training boosted my confidence and reviewing the dive flow in mind over and over again just filled in the gaps. I was/am even sure about handling parachute malfunction and using reserve, however, I don\u0026rsquo;t wish it upon me or anyone else for that matter.\nI was not really scared at first but then my jump kept postponing giving more time to think. I was getting nervous towards the end and it shows in the video. Last thing I told myself was that even if I die, it will not be a boring death; I\u0026rsquo;d rather die doing something exciting! Anyway, this post is to let everyone know that anyone can do it. If you want to do it, all you have to do is just do it because you might never get a chance again!\n The video from my first skydive(homepage) - I dedicate it to the people involved in the India Against Corruption.

I hadn\u0026rsquo;t met him in nearly 6-7 years until a couple of days ago when I met him Chicago. We went skydiving, and visited Lake Geneva and had good time together. Meeting him brought back many memories from my childhood and school days and inspired me to write. I think, it\u0026rsquo;s time to share and put them down here before they are completely erased from my already weak memories. So, here it goes, arranged in order with my failing recollection of my childhood\u0026hellip;\nMy Story Days before my school - when I was under 5.   The railway track\n   Well, there\u0026rsquo;s is nothing much to say. Other than a couple of visuals I have in my head about those days. I don\u0026rsquo;t recollect spending the first six months of my life in Coorg. My mom says, Dad moved the family to Bangalore looking for a job. We were in Venkateshapuram for six months and then moved to Kadugondanahalli for about two years. I remember it was close to a railway track. My dad and uncles would take me to the track and tell me how the train creates magic and turns the coin kept on the track into a magnet! I used to wonder.\n  nut and bolt\n   The only other thing I remember about the track was that once my brother and I went to the track and found a bolt near the track and got it home. At home, mom got a little upset thinking we had removed it from the track, and told us that the it can cause an accident and the train might have gone off the track. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about my, then extremely mischievous, brother but I was terrified. Thankfully, no train went off the track that day.\n  sparrow\n   Once my brother went missing. He used to run behind those insects, dragon flies, sparrows, catching them and playing with them. So, my parents, uncles, entire neighborhood went frantic and thought someone might have abducted him. When they decided to lodge a police complaint, he walked in holding an old military man\u0026rsquo;s hands who the entire neighborhood knew. Apparently, he was chasing after a bird and had gone quite a distant where the old man spotted him and brought him back. (My brother hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed; in his recent facebook picture, he had a green parrot on his shoulder!)\n  Bicycle\n   We owned three bicycles. So, we used to go to church on Davis road every Sunday. Mom and Dad on one cycle, my brother and I used to ride on our uncles\u0026rsquo; bicycles. Every time on the way back, these crazy people used to bet and race home! I can\u0026rsquo;t forget the testicle-crushing experience sitting on the front bar of the bicycles. My dad and all my uncles had Hero cycles and the kids used to get the front bar without any seat to sit on. I recall my dad taking me along with him to get ration from far far away place. They finally fitted it with a small seat heeding an old Muslim uncle\u0026rsquo;s advice. Those used to be hell of a rides! And fortunately nothing was ever crushed. That uncle was god send! 😉\nThen, that dark place. It was the ground floor of Ranka (Corner or Park) apartments where my dad used to sell tea and coffee to the construction workers. Usually the ground floor is where they park the cars, it\u0026rsquo;s not the basement. I was on the walkway and to my right was the building and to the left was the apartment complex compound and some trees. I remember looking at the ground floor through the dark spots here and there. I don\u0026rsquo;t recall anything, nothing scared me, but I still have this visual very rich in my mind.\nWhere did we move from Kadugondanahalli?

We were in same class in Bangalore for six years starting 1990 before I had to leave. We were not in touch and had not met more than a handful of times in the last fifteen years.

I used to wonder what made them do what they did especially when the person who did it was indeed very poor. Why didn\u0026rsquo;t s/he keep it her/himself, used it to feed his family, made a life out of it. One moment I would think, returning it made no sense at all and the next moment I would just imagine the plight of the people who lost it. What if someone lost all their hard earned money, a life time of savings, what if if was from a poor father carrying it to arrange for his daughter\u0026rsquo;s wedding? It made perfect sense to return it. The happiness that it\u0026rsquo;d bring when one loses something precious and find it later; the good feel that it\u0026rsquo;d instill in one\u0026rsquo;s heart; the give-back/do-the-same-thing attitude that it\u0026rsquo;d bring seemed much more valuable than the actual item\u0026rsquo;s worth.\nIf I found even a handful of rupees on the road and if I knew who it belonged to, my mom would ask me to return it. My parents taught me that to die in hunger is much more satiable than stealing or cheating. However, I\u0026rsquo;d listen to them, though very rare, discussing about bribing to get things done because everyone else does and there\u0026rsquo;s no other way. For a lower middle class family living on daily wages, bribing might have looked so easy. But I was never asked to follow the same; they\u0026rsquo;d always preach me against it! I never wanted to bribe, instead I\u0026rsquo;d argue that it\u0026rsquo;s their duty to serve people and they get paid for it and there is no need to pay a bribe. Even the good old movies, in which the hero fights the officials against corruption, used to influence me as a kid.\nIn schools, my teachers would always urge us to fight against things like dowry and bribery. The haves can do it but what about the have-nots? The deeds of the haves will haunt the have-nots and it\u0026rsquo;d become a vicious circle of influence. They\u0026rsquo;d call it an epidemic and rightly so. Honesty and ethics is what they taught me in school. Always. Even during my college days, I hated corruption, bribery. I used think, it\u0026rsquo;s very easy not to pay a bribe. There\u0026rsquo;s media, police, Internet, and what not to bring such incidents to light, but then those involved have no shame. Then there was Lokayukta. People were so impressed that they\u0026rsquo;d call Lokayukta if somebody asked for a bribe. Even that fell apart after a while; eventually everyone realized that Lokayukta had no real power! The common man had no other option but to surrender.\nIn 2010, I paid rupees 100/- to my travel agent for getting a four wheeler driving license in spite of driving reasonably well during the road test. Why? After the tests, the agent was collecting 100/- from every one saying that the RTO inspector demanded it. Everyone there was paying it and so did I! I will never know if the inspector asked for it or it was just the agent fooling us. But whatever it is, I fell for peer pressure and I paid a bribe!\nEven with such teaching and bringing up, I paid a bribe! Why? As we get older and mature, with all that we see and experience, it is easy and reasonable to think that paying a bribe and getting things done is the easiest way. It\u0026rsquo;s very difficult to fight the system; it forces you to become part of it. As grown ups, we don\u0026rsquo;t have time to think about the profound repercussions of paying a bribe. We don\u0026rsquo;t realize that it rots the roots of our society. The mob mentality also has such a great influence. The very thought that \u0026lsquo;everyone does it; if I don\u0026rsquo;t, I will be left behind\u0026rsquo; leaves no room our ethics. It\u0026rsquo;s a race out there after all and I succumbed to that race.\nI am ashamed of what I did. I really am and I have decided that I will never pay a bribe again. NEVER EVER. The fight against corruption should start from within.\nHave you paid a bribe? What are your views on it?\nPS: I\u0026rsquo;m one of those who believes that \u0026lsquo;power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.\u0026rsquo; The Jan Lokpal bill proposed by Anna Hazare and co. gives such high power to the bureau that it frightens me. In spite of it, I\u0026rsquo;m all in for the fight against corruption. Just like any other young Indian elsewhere, I\u0026rsquo;m sick of family politics, the bloody politicians, and the corrupt officials. All I hope is that this will bring the much needed change in the system and awareness among the people.

But the mother nature had some other plans. Six friends and I had planned for a skydiving weekend on my room-mate\u0026rsquo;s birthday last Saturday. Two of them had come down from Chicago. The venue was none other than the closest Skydive Midwest. None of us had previous experience and were looking forward to having a great time. We reached the place a couple of minutes after our scheduled time and registered at the manifest. Basically, we just put our lives on the line and signed contracts saying Skydive Midwest will not be liable for any accidents. Six of us were to do tandem jumps and I solo (Accelerated Free Fall - AFF). Don\u0026rsquo;t ask me why I decided to jump solo; I don\u0026rsquo;t know!\n  It rained during out skydiving\n   A French guy was my only classmate! My classes went until noon and by the time I was out my group also had training. And then it was the waiting game. It rained heavily once and the plane had to come back without any jumps. By evening, our turn had come. My group completed their tandem jumps by 6PM and was ecstatic and engrossed in the pictures and videos of themselves skydiving! I was scheduled to go in load 21 and it was only 17th load running at that time. Within an hour the weather changed - it got very dark; clouds moved in and wind picked up speed. AFF jumps were canceled for the day.\nI went again on Sunday morning; everything was perfect except the north winds. I decided to visit later in the day and left.\nBtw, I must tell you, the staff at Skydive Midwest is so amazing. We loved the day spent at Skydive Midwest. Though I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to dive, it was worth spending a day with friends; attending the classes with a wonderful teacher (Susanne); another young lady staff I talked to; patiently waiting; watching people; cute announcement once in a while; and lovely Laura at the manifest.\n  Fountain at The Riviera, Lake Geneva\n   After returning from Skydive Midwest on Sunday, I took my visiting friends to Milwaukee Arts Museum and a bit of lake side for site seeing. We then headed to Lake Geneva (fourth time for me!). The plan was to rent a boat and spend time but due to time crunch we decided to take the boat tour around Lake Geneva. I skipped it this time. The group had been on boat and I walked around the shore path between the lake and the houses for sometime.\nAnyway, I dropped my friends to Kenosha Metra station and came back to Milwaukee in the evening. On my way back, the weather was good and it didn\u0026rsquo;t look as windy as it looked in the morning. I was supposed to go Skydiving in the evening if the weather turned out good; but, I dropped the plan as I was too tired and didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like going. Now, I need to rent a car again to go skydiving which costs me around $50!\nWhatever it is, my personal record of jumping from a whopping 6 feet above the ground still stands unbeaten!

These methods also use jQuery\u0026rsquo;s animate() method. To best view the code in action click on RESET before clicking on the buttons.\nDo you have a better way of scrolling elements? Ideas/comments/suggestions are always welcome.\n The simplest one will be to use an anchor tag: Note that the anchor can be used on any element with an ID.

This wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessary but just an exercise to learn what it takes to move the posts. It was easy after a lot of reading. Here is a checklist I prepared. Hope it helps someone looking for similar stuff. Comments and suggestions are welcome. Use it at your own risk!\n   WordPress: Install WordPress.\n  Plugins: Install necessary plugins. Enable all of them and set them up. Some plugins do provide an option to import/export settings. Export settings from old blog to a file and replace all occurrences of old blog URL to new blog if needed.\n  Export Database: Using MyPHP Admin from CPanel export the all tables from old WordPress database except wp_options. (I\u0026rsquo;m not sure about other tables but this one gave me some problems when I imported). Also export the entire database for the new blog before next step so that you can clean it up by importing the new database SQL in case anything goes wrong.\n  Import database: Replace all occurrences of old blog URL in the backup file and import the tables (basically run the SQL file). If you see anything amiss, try exporting and importing the tables excluded in previous step!\n  Permanent Redirect: Once the old blog is gone, all links on the web pointing to the old blog posts will throw 404 error and will affect the site rankings. To avoid the side effect and to keep all traffic to the new blog, redirect the old URLs to new ones. This can be done via plugins. However, I noticed that the plugin needed me to keep the posts on old blog as well for it to work which I didn\u0026rsquo;t like. There were also other problems. So, I ended up adding 301 (permanent) redirects in the .htaccess file.\n  Check redirect: test a couple of old blog post links and see if 301 redirect works correct.\n  Test new blog: go to new blog and just click on links and mess around a bit to make sure nothing is broken esp. the tags, categories, and other meta stuff.\n  Delete old blog post: Delete (move to trash) the old blog posts on the old blog. Don\u0026rsquo;t remove them completely yet; you can keep that task when you are sure everything is setup correctly.\n  Update Tags and Categories: Go to the old blog and delete all tags and categories that were unique to the moved posts. Easiest way is to check if they have any posts associated with them. If there are none, just get rid of them. The new blog will have tags and categories from old blog due to import. Delete orphan tags and categories from new blog as well.\n  Update other settings: if you are using custom search engines, AdSense, Analytics etc, make sure you update the settings on the new blog.\n  Media: Move the media (such as images, videos, documents etc) to new blog. Since we did a replace all on the SQL file, the image URLs will be pointing to the new blog.\n  RSS: The most important task. Provide correct RSS. If you do not want your old blog RSS subscribers to get new blog RSS, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to do anything. If you want to provide old as well as new posts to the subscribers, you need some more settings. This is where services like FeedBurner are valuable. If you are using FeedBurner and want the original RSS to include both old and new blog posts, create a combined RSS feed using Yahoo Pipes. You can update the FeedBurner settings to include the Yahoo piped RSS so that RSS readers will continue to get all posts. Don\u0026rsquo;t fret if you are not using FeedBurner. You can create one now and redirect your old RSS link to FeedBurner\u0026rsquo;s link using htaccess. Once that is done, just use pipes as described above. The Subscribe All option I provide uses Yahoo Pipes.\n   Comments and suggestions are welcome.\n","href":"/blog/wordpress-moving-some-old-posts-to-a-new-blog/","title":"WordPress: Moving Some Old Posts To A New Blog"},{"content":"Around three months ago, I was shocked looking at some newly added code in one of our applications. It was naked. Not a single line of comment whatsoever!! I asked the person who wrote it to explain the code and it turned out that the code is indeed very cleverly written. I\u0026rsquo;d rate the code as top notch if only it had comments. When I demanded an explanation, it turned out that he thinks commenting is an utterly boring task. We had a small chat and after explaining how difficult it is to maintain the code without comments, he agreed to add comments, albeit reluctantly. I saved a copy of the code before he added comments.\nBack to present: An end users had an issue in the existing application and also had a change request to the functionality. It was to be assigned to the person who wrote it originally. I sat with him and pulled the copy of the code I had saved. He had trouble understanding the code and asked himself, \u0026lsquo;what am I doing here?\u0026rsquo;, a couple of times.

It all depends on the auction sites. They control the bidding with bots on the server side which keeps bidding until there is no one else to place a bid thus keeping the item as well as the price for bidding. However, they do frequently give some items away to make it look legitimate and fool people into participating. I\u0026rsquo;m not guessing this; I\u0026rsquo;m convinced that this is what they do.

This can be found when the bidding ends. Usually there will be a style (class) applied to the timer or winner DIV element. Just keep the Inspect Element window open and notice the change at the end of the bid.\n  Last but not least, find out how a bid is placed. This could be a bit tricky. Once you are logged in, inspect the bid button and find out how the bid is being placed.

I will also give an example script for a virtual auction site. At the end of this post series, one should be able to build a script on their own. I hope.\n  Basics of HTML How to dissect a web page Requirements for the script Preparation for the script Build the script Using the script  Update - [ Part II ] \u0026amp; [ Part III ]\n 1. Basics of HTML HTML basics are necessary to make this idea work. Google may be a good start. I will, however, explain the least basic thing needed.\nHTML is a markup language used to build the websites. Each page on the website is made up of a number of different elements such as dropdowns, input text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, paragraphs of text etc. Each of these elements will be represented by a element tag in HTML. Dropdowns are \u0026lt;SELECT\u0026gt;; paragraphs are \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;; a group of elements in a container - called div - are \u0026lt;DIV\u0026gt;.\nEach and every element in the mark up language can be given an identifier. This identifier can be used to fetch the element and it\u0026rsquo;s children using JavaScript. For e.g. a button is \u0026lt;input type=\u0026quot;button\u0026quot; id=\u0026quot;btnID\u0026quot;\u0026gt; abd it can be identified using document.getElementById(\u0026quot;btnID\u0026quot;) in JavaScript or simply $(\u0026quot;#btnID\u0026quot;) in jQuery.\nSimilarly, there are methods and properties around these elements that can be used to read, write, and manipulate the elements. For e.g. the following code will click the button using the script - document.getElementById(\u0026quot;btnID\u0026quot;).click() or $(\u0026quot;#btnID\u0026quot;).click()\nThen, there are styles. Styles are used to decorate the elements on a web page. A text in big red font is a style; a underlined text is also through a style. These styles are usually placed in .css files, also called as style-sheets.\n//a line in style sheet .styleName {font-size:100px;} // An element in web page \u0026lt;DIV id=\u0026#34;divID\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;styleName\u0026#34;\u0026gt; This is 100px text! \u0026lt;/DIV\u0026gt; // accessing it using JavaScript document.getElementById(\u0026#34;divID\u0026#34;) //OR document.getElementsByClassName(\u0026#34;styleName\u0026#34;) //OR $(\u0026#34;#divID\u0026#34;) //OR $(\u0026#34;.styleName\u0026#34;)  These basics should help one in extracting the fields that show the bid timer, last bidder, item code, last bid amount elements, and their identifiers.\n2. How to dissect a web page Once the basics of HTML are familiar, one need to know how to dissect the web pages at a very high level. This is needed so that one can get the elements, identifiers of the bidding site, and build a bot to bid without any manual intervention. There are many ways of looking at the internals of the web pages.\nMost basic will be to right click on the page and view page source and searching for the element using the text. This, however, is not the best that is available. FireBug can be used on the FireFox browser to get to the internals. Similarly, on Chromium browser, any element can be directly reached by right-clicking on the element and selecting Inspect Element. I\u0026rsquo;d suggest using Chromium browser because of its simplicity in this matter. Go right ahead and Inspect Element for the bid timer. See how the timer keeps changing in the source as well. Give particular emphasis on the element tags, the identifiers, and the styles (class).\nmore to follow\u0026hellip;\n","href":"/blog/penny-auction-sites-auto-bidding-script-bid-sniper-how-to-introduction/","title":"Penny Auction Sites Auto Bidding Script (Bid Sniper)"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/tutorial/","title":"tutorial"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/graph/","title":"graph"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/heatwave/","title":"heatwave"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/snow/","title":"snow"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/summer/","title":"summer"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/temperature/","title":"temperature"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/weather/","title":"weather"},{"content":"You know by now, I\u0026rsquo;m a bit concerned about this weather.

What project you are going to work on? More about the project? What are your roles in the project? US salary? Location of visit? Your highest degree? How long have you been with your employer? Show old passports. Give an example of a scenario where you successfully implemented a solution. Responsibilities? are there any other responsibilities? What will you do in US? Past project experience? Your company details? Just high level should be fine. Client company details? Why you and not someone else? What are you going to do for this company? Travel date. Stay info. Contact in US. Length of the stay? What after H1B expires/concludes.  Actual questions asked to me during the interview -\n What is your highest degree? Specialization? Which client? Show abc/xyz document.  Note that it\u0026rsquo;s not exhaustive, I just made this not get caught off guard. Best advice I can give is be calm, just answer to the point. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have any problem as long as you have a legitimate reason for the travel.

This is a cool forum where you not only get your questions answered but also learn. Learn a lot, in fact. I always enjoy learning from others\u0026rsquo; experience and mistakes; it\u0026rsquo;s dirty but it is also very easy and fast. This is exactly what Stackoverflow is providing me; an opportunity to learn from others\u0026rsquo; knowledge. I\u0026rsquo;m also having fun with their reputation points.\nI was trying to answer this question (which deals with a master and a number of checkboxes) and came up with a code which worked only in jQuery version \u0026lt;1.6\n// Code that works with \u0026lt;1.6; uses attr() $(function () { $(\u0026#34;#checkall\u0026#34;).click(function () { $(this).parents(\u0026#34;fieldset:eq(0)\u0026#34;).find(\u0026#34;:checkbox\u0026#34;).attr(\u0026#34;checked\u0026#34;, this.checked); }); $(\u0026#34;input[type=checkbox]:not(#checkall)\u0026#34;).click(function(){ if(!this.checked) { // at least one is unchecked; uncheck checkall  $(\u0026#34;#checkall\u0026#34;).attr(\u0026#34;checked\u0026#34;, this.checked); } else { // check if all are checked and set checkall accordingly  $(\u0026#34;#checkall\u0026#34;).attr(\u0026#34;checked\u0026#34;,!$(\u0026#34;input[type=checkbox]:not(#checkall)\u0026#34;).filter(\u0026#34;:not(:checked)\u0026#34;).length); } }); });  After a couple of minutes of tinkering, it just occurred to me that this was due to the prop method that I read about a day or two earlier. Just changing the attr to prop worked like a charm.\nHowever, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to fix it and this is where the community knowledge came to the rescue. A user named Matt Ball pointed me to his jQuery-CheckAll plugin and asked me to take a look.\nThe fix was/is to check if prop exists or not and use it if it does. Notice the syntax of calling the prop/attr method in below code.\n// Code that works with any version; uses attr()/prop() $(function() { // Ripped from https://github.com/mjball/jQuery-CheckAll  var propFn = typeof $.fn.prop === \u0026#34;function\u0026#34; ? \u0026#34;prop\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;attr\u0026#34;; $(\u0026#34;#checkall\u0026#34;).click(function() { $(this).parents(\u0026#34;fieldset:eq(0)\u0026#34;).find(\u0026#34;:checkbox\u0026#34;)[propFn](\u0026#34;checked\u0026#34;, this.checked); }); $(\u0026#34;input[type=checkbox]:not(#checkall)\u0026#34;).click(function() { if (!this.checked) { // at least one is unchecked; uncheck checkall  $(\u0026#34;#checkall\u0026#34;)[propFn](\u0026#34;checked\u0026#34;, this.checked); } else { // check if all are checked and set checkall accordingly  $(\u0026#34;#checkall\u0026#34;)[propFn](\u0026#34;checked\u0026#34;, !$(\u0026#34;input[type=checkbox]:not(#checkall)\u0026#34;).filter(\u0026#34;:not(:checked)\u0026#34;).length); } }); });  My answer to that question - here.

He also wanted to display the days in 3 digits.\nI did reply with changes but it had a defect due to a last minute change! So, I wrote a clean script which is the reason for this post. One main improvement here is, the script doesn\u0026rsquo;t update every second. Updating the day counter every second is not needed since the number of days doesn\u0026rsquo;t change every second. The below script updates the counter only when the day count mentioned in the counter has to change.\nAs always, in case of any issues/doubts/suggestions or you just want to appreciate, feel free to leave a comment.\nUpdate: I have moved the code to GitHub - JavaScript Counters.\nJavascript Counter to Count just the days - This script is very simple; it takes a date to count the time from or to, an ID to put the timer in. To be very precise, this counter shows the total number of 24 hours intervals between the date-time given and current date-time. It is also possible to have more than one timer on a page.

There were a lot of people; I could see a lot of Indians as well. You probably won\u0026rsquo;t believe me but I met my a friend from my college (India) with his friends on Goat Island, I had no clue he was also visiting. Then I met another friend of mine from Bangalore on the Observation Tower! My friends were right when they said be prepared to see the place full of desis.\n  Canada from Goat Island\n   We first went to Terrapin Point, Goat Island. Thundering water, dense mist raising up in the sky, it was beautiful. Goat Island divides the Niagara River and lies in the middle of Niagara Falls between the Bridal Veil Falls and Horseshoe Falls.\n  Terrapin Point\n   The entire falls is divided into American and Canadian (Horseshoe) falls based on border. Canadian falls falls between Terrapin Point (US) and Table Rock (Canada).\nWe then went to Bridal Veil Falls, Niagara Falls Observation Tower and from there we went went to Maid of The Mist.\n  Maid of Mist boat\n   It is a boat tour that takes you directly into the dense mist of spray inside the curve of the Horseshoe Falls. You will be covered in plastic ponchos so that you can enjoy the view without getting completely wet. It was difficult even to open eyes completely but it was amazing to get so close to the falls. The sheer volume of the water pouring downwards left us speechless.\n  Bridal Falls\n   From there, we went to the Cave of Winds which surprisingly doesn\u0026rsquo;t have caves anymore! The caves are destroyed due to a rockfall in 1950s. The elevator took us down to the river level and then we walked right up to the base of the Bridal Veil Falls with water thundering down on us. Even though the water hit us so hard that we couldn\u0026rsquo;t stand properly, I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like coming back from there. It\u0026rsquo;s amazing.\n  Cave of Winds\n    Cave of Winds\n    Cave of Winds Deck\n   Make sure to cover up all you cellphones etc. in waterproof bags before going there or better yet take turns and have someone safe-keep it. Most importantly, make sure your pants are tight and don\u0026rsquo;t wash down. 😜\nWe headed back to Observation Tower to watch the lighting of the falls. We had quite a wait there and it was getting colder and heavy winds just worsened the condition. However, it was worth the wait. The falls looked so lovely. This is a must watch. Then we had dinner in Top of The Falls restaurant there and caught a glimpse of the fireworks - it was a great view.\n  Bridal Falls from Observation Tower\n    Niagara(Bridal Falls) lighting\n   Then it was the inevitable - head back to the hotel, catch a flight, get back home thing.\nNotice how many times I used amazing, that\u0026rsquo;s because it indeed is.

During the long weekend of September 2010, I visited Cedar Point and Niagara falls along with three other friends. It was an awesome trip. We took a flight from Milwaukee to Cleveland Ohio and rented a car from airport for the entire trip. The plan was to go to Cedar Point one day, visit Niagara next day, and head back the day after.\nFirst we drove to Cedar Point (Sandusky Ohio) from Marriott (Cleveland Airport Marriott). It was already noon by the time we reached there. It looked a bit scary from outside. All those roller coasters, best in America rankings, and never-before-sat-in-a-roller-coaster feeling. Once we were inside there were huge lines near all coasters and rides. It was obvious that we would not be able to cover all of it especially because my friend and I wanted to sit at the very front in all rides that we take that day. So, we decided to hit the best of Cedar Point.\n  Millennium Force, best of 2010\n   First up was Millennium Force, the number 1 roller coaster of 2010 and in top 2 places since it was opened in 2000. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t scared until the last 2-3 minutes or so. A lady waiting for the 2nd row got to know that this was my first roller coaster ride and she started scaring the hell out of me. She had been there a couple of times but never dared to sit front and that was the first time on the 2nd row for her.\n \u0026ldquo;You are a brave man. Don\u0026rsquo;t shit in your pants\u0026rdquo;, she said!\n When the coaster started and going up inch by inch, my heart was beating faster. I could hear the screams from other riders. I was almost on the verge of calling it a mistake when it stopped for a moment at the top. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have any time to savor the beautiful Lake Erie on the left, all we were worried about was the 300 feet fall at 80 freaking degrees*. In the end, it was mind blowing! I wanted to do it again!\nNever ever miss such a ride and when you are there, just stop thinking and get to the very first row. You will thank me for the advice.\nThese are some other rides we took:\n Corkscrew Gemini Blue Streak Magnum XL-200 Mantis Maverick Mean Streak Top Thrill Dragster  We missed Raptor. If you are visiting then just make sure you look up for the extremes and don\u0026rsquo;t miss it. (Check Google image search)\n  Top Thrill Dragster\n   I can\u0026rsquo;t close this episode without mentioning the fastest and the second tallest ride - Top Thrill Dragster. 120mph (190km/h) is enough to get the idea. We had a slow start - in fact, even the slowest snail would have over taken us during the initial pick-up! Then it just stopped and didn\u0026rsquo;t move for may be 5 minutes and there I was in the front row with my friend. It was kind of awkward! But when it did start, it went vroooom! It was so fast that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get my hands up in the air, I felt my cheeks trembling and getting dragged backwards due to the force. Then the approximately 90 degree raise and fall. Crazy!\nWe had dinner there and then finished it off with Wicked Twister and maXair before heading back to Marriott.

If you have no clue, this post isn\u0026rsquo;t for you and if you want to know what it is, it is an ugly looking additional \u0026ldquo;/blog/\u0026rdquo; in the permalinks (URLs) in your website that comes free with the multisite feature in WordPress. Why ugly? Because it comes uninvited, it\u0026rsquo;s there and most probably you don\u0026rsquo;t want it.\nHow do you remove the additional \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo; in the URL of your posts? Simple, install some plugin which does it for you? That is what I thought; however, before doing so, I just took a careful look at the wp_options table. BAM! There it was. After spending about 30 minutes with settings and checking the data in this table, I have figured out a way to solve the blog slug problem without the need for a plugin. No need to change a bit of code. You don\u0026rsquo;t even need to execute any queries. The query and the table values are shown below just to indicate what your action does to the database values. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple process; only step 2 and 3 need your action, you can skip the rest!\nJust read on and try it out on your blog. I have also added the explanation (a little that I know). Beware, I haven\u0026rsquo;t read more than 10 lines of PHP code, so I don\u0026rsquo;t know what happens in the code but I\u0026rsquo;m 100% sure on what the end result will be.\nEdit: Mladen put all whys and hows to rest in a comment below.

This is because the above step only updates permalinks(wp_options.permalink_structure) and the records look like this:     option_id blog_id option_name option_value autoload     1234 0 permalink_structure %postname%/ yes   5678 0 rewrite_rules :77:{s:52:\u0026ldquo;blog/category/(.+?)/feed/(feed|rdf|rss\u0026hellip; yes     Update rewrite rules.\nGo to Site » move cursor on main site name(/) » Dashboard » Settings » Permalink. Notice Custom Structure. You will see that blog/ is outside the textbox and %postname%/ appears in the textbox. Do not edit or save anything on this page. Now, the data in the table looks like:     option_id blog_id option_name option_value autoload     1234 0 permalink_structure %postname%/ yes   5678 0 rewrite_rules :77:{s:47:\u0026ldquo;category/(.+?)/feed/(feed|rdf|rss\u0026hellip; yes    What happens is that when you visit this page, rewrite_rules gets changed automatically. May be it has something to do with autoload column, I don\u0026rsquo;t know!\n A few things I noticed:\n The value updated in step 2, goes to database as is and just to permalink_structure record. Any value updated in step 3, updates both rows mentioned above. WordPress takes the value in the database, removes the \u0026ldquo;/blog/\u0026rdquo; substring from it and shows the remaining in the textbox in step 3. The \u0026ldquo;blog/\u0026rdquo; shown outside the textbox is kinda fooling you. Wordpress adds \u0026ldquo;/blog/\u0026rdquo; to any value in the textbox updated from step 3 and updates both records in the database. That is the reason, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t update the permalinks from the page in step 3; it will automatically get \u0026ldquo;/blog/\u0026rdquo; added to the front of it and we will be back to square one.   Once done, visit the blog and click on any post. You should see the post and the permalink (URL) shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have the \u0026ldquo;blog slug\u0026rdquo;. If you still see it or if you are getting 404 error, you have screwed up something. Antonio left a tip on how to solve the 404s in his comment below. Take a look if need be.\nLeave a comment on this blog saying how useful it was or how stupid I really am. If I take a look at the code someday, I will be sure to let you know how exactly it works. If you do know already, please leave a comment.\nOh, I also noticed that WordPress auto corrects the permalinks (URLs) even if you enter it wrong. For e.g. if your blog post is \u0026ldquo;example.com/somepost\u0026rdquo;, WordPress will take you to the right page even if you enter \u0026ldquo;example.com/YouCantSeeMe/somepost\u0026rdquo;! It could be that, WordPress uses RegEx or some matching algorithm that compares from right to left and if it finds a match, it will take you to the page even if there are \u0026ldquo;/.*/\u0026rdquo; left on the left. Just a guess! Any idea?\nCheck this for more info - How does WordPress handle permalinks?\n","href":"/blog/how-to-remove-the-blog-slug-from-the-permalinksurl-in-wordpress-multisite-installation-without-a-plugin/","title":"How To Remove The /blog/ slug From The Permalinks(URL) Without A Plugin"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/permalink/","title":"permalink"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/slug/","title":"slug"},{"content":"Continued from here\u0026hellip;\nAdvantages/Disadvantages: Advantages of multiple blogs include monetization, ease of finding advertisers, reaching right audience, and building a resource of articles all in the same niche.

However, you can read further to find out my tale with giving myself a haircut for the first time.\nWhen I was kid, I had this dream, albeit shot-lived, of becoming an hairstylist. But then I went to college trying to become an engineer! One fine day back from a bad haircut, I was thinking about it and decided to style my own hair for the first time. Just to give it a try! After some thinking, the easiest style was to go bald which is exactly what I used to do back in college; I used to shave my head twice a week and sport a beard. It continued for a couple months not only because I liked it but also due to the over-pouring compliments from friends and all those heads turned! So, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the first time I designed my own hairstyle.\n  Before The Haircut Experiment\n   I started off thinking that I will shave my head and started looking for a shaver. The electric shavers are used extensively here in US compared to India and there are a lot of varieties and a vast price range. When I got down to finding out the good electric shavers and started reading about the reviews, I realized that it can never be as close a shave as with a razor and it actually takes same amount of time if not more. So I dropped the idea of buying an electric shaver.\nDuring those browsing sessions I got to know about the hair clippers and decided to try them instead. The thought of not having to take an appointment a week before was very enticing. It\u0026rsquo;s the couple of YouTube videos that really gave me the confidence. It was really not about self-independence nor saving money; I really just wanted to give it a try!\n  After The Haircut Experiment - not bad?\n   After some research, I shortlisted three hair-clippers and finally bought Wahl 79524 24-Piece Deluxe Hair Clipper Kit. The main reason for buying it out of three was that I was a little skeptical about the worth and it was the cheapest of the lot. It turned out to be a good clipper; I have used it for last four months and have no complaints except that it becomes a little loud if used continuously at one stretch.\n  The Haircut Experiment Photographer - myself\n      Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper - The best, but mainly for professionals.\n  Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade - The best choice for individuals.

I do not have much knowledge about the Wordpress framework either. The following post is based on my previous couple of hours of reading on multisite blogging. Feel free to enlighten me in the comment section.\nWhy? If you are starting/have started blogging as a hobby, at first it may seem that having one blog and blogging everything in it is a good idea. However, after sometime you will feel as if you should keep the posts separate and in their own blogs rather than having them all in under one blog. I was no different; I never gave much time to think about it until one of my readers (second category below) sent me a message.\n Keep all the technical crap separate; I don\u0026rsquo;t care if you are a computer scientist!\n So, now back to our question - why? There is no one size fits all answer. The decision to keep the personal and technical blogs separate could be based on many factors such as the audience, the purpose of your blog, You etc.\n1. The Audience Know your audience. More importantly, know if you care about your audience. Audience come in two categories - those who come off of search engines and those who don\u0026rsquo;t.\nThe audience coming off search engines visit your site searching for specific information and the search engines are smart enough to land them in the correct page. If you have categorized and tagged your posts consistently, then such users should not have problem finding the information they are looking for. Additionally, you can also provide related posts, internal links, custom search options. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about the search engine users. Retaining such users is up to you and the information on your site and also their willingness to commit to the mistakes again. 😝\nThe other kind of audience - friends, family, co-workers, those choose to follow your blog, loyal readers, stalkers, potential employers etc. It\u0026rsquo;s rare that this audience is interested in everything you write. You might regularly get comments such as the one I mentioned above. Here it is up to you to decide. You can have multiple blogs to cater different audience or you can have a good categorization and tagging in your blog to make their life easier. Or like me, just have faith in your audience ability to find what they want and ignore what they don\u0026rsquo;t.\nFor the loyal readers, you can always provide subscription options such as categorized feeds, email notifications based on their interest and even phone calls! haha!\n2. The purpose of your blog If you are like me, who is into blogging just for the fun of it you are probably better off with a single blog. If you are blogging about only one specific subject, why do you need a second blog?\nIf you are serious about your blog, then it\u0026rsquo;s completely a different ball game. If you are into blogging for money (full time blogging) then you should definitely go with different blogs and stick to the niche you select. It is easier for you and for the advertisers to target the visitors this way. Would it be appropriate to display a smart-phone ad on one of your cooking posts? (Of-course you can display ads based on category of the post but that\u0026rsquo;s a different story). The purpose of the blog has a large influence on the decision.\n3. Finally, You! Well, it all comes down to you and your needs, ideas, thinking. You can think about all these points and then make a decision or just say screw it and go with one blog.\nOne thing which I didn\u0026rsquo;t mention is all this time is time. Yep, TIME. Multiple blogs take up a lot of time. Even a single blog for that matter needs a lot of your time, devotion and love. If you are not into full time blogging, you are better off with a single blog.\nIf you are not into full time blogging and have multiple successful blogs, you are a rockstar. You probably type with your hands and foot at the same time and beat Chuck Norris in typing! 😃\nI\u0026rsquo;m not done yet, come back for another installment on this topic.

When I look back, no matter how fulfilling it was I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what I worked on, but all I remember is the very fact that I didn\u0026rsquo;t go and spend time with my loved ones! 😞\nQuit smoking a couple of times: Well, I\u0026rsquo;m not lying, I broke all promises. I am and will be truly embarrassed about this one. The last time I ever quit without giving myself another chance to quit was about three months ago.\nWork, work and more work: This is the very reason this post was so long due. May be you should be happy about this, it didn\u0026rsquo;t give me enough time to write! 😉\nThis list is by no means complete.

This time just for a day. I loved skiing last time so much that when I heard that another group was heading to Cascade Mountains, I simply couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist.\nWe had two guys who had never skied before so we helped them on the bunny hills and moved on to others slopes. Though I\u0026rsquo;m a newbie I could tell that the snow at the Ski Brule was better. At Cascade it was kind of slippery compared to Ski Brule. May be it was due to the weather, it was mid 30s. Duh!\nThe very second slope Cottontail had some \u0026lsquo;bumps\u0026rsquo; where one could catch some air. It was great setup to learn. I had some problem landing, mostly my posture wasn\u0026rsquo;t correct, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t leaning forward as much as I wanted to just before hitting the snow. Fell down once or twice. My left ski kept coming off most of the times.\n  Cascade Mountain Trail Map\n   My left show was lose. At Ski Brule I got 9.5 shoe which was perfect. But here, they had no 9.5 and 9 was a little lose and 8 was too tight. After some time on the slope I had to return and get another 9 which was slightly better.\nI moved on to Adele\u0026rsquo;s Alley, Upper Adele\u0026rsquo;s, Badger Pass etc. I kept falling down a lot because of loosing my left ski. Once on a Super Park (black), I fell down and landed on the left ski and couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop sliding down easily! I took it to the rental and the guy there noticed that the stopper (not sure what they are called; but they stop the ski from sliding when they are unhooked from shoes) was sticking out. I got the ski repaired but my confidence was already damaged. I didn\u0026rsquo;t dare to go on a black diamond again.\nCascade Mountain was different compared to Ski Brule. At Cascade, I could try a lot of combinations such as start on blue, get onto green and go down bunny hills etc. I covered everything to the left of Upper North Wall and Mogul Monster. Once we went almost till the edge where Mogul starts and came back terrified! 😁\n  Lobo(Cascade Mountain)\n   The very last time, I went down on Manitou to Upper Ptarmigan to Badger Pass to Adele\u0026rsquo;s Alley to Cottontail. On Cottontail, hit the bumps and caught more air than before. Then I saw my friend falling down in front and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist pointing finger and laughing at him. The very next bump, you guessed it, I fell down! Sucker!\nIt was a great trip. I did learn a bit more about turning, going across to slow down. But still not good enough, I need to earn how to hold the posture. I tend to lean a little back and the center of gravity throws me off balance and onto the snow. I tried so hard but couldn\u0026rsquo;t push the shins against the boot all the time. I should ski more; I\u0026rsquo;d love to go again!\n","href":"/blog/skiing-on-cascade-mountains-wisconsin/","title":"Skiing on Cascade mountains, Wisconsin"},{"content":"This is Sunday afternoon, I\u0026rsquo;m bored and I\u0026rsquo;m planning to prepare Chocolate Brownies.

The slopes looked so beautiful and scary at the same time. I was excited to ski for the first time the very next day.\n  With Staff on bunny hills\n   When we reached there, there was a free lessons for first timers (should register beforehand). The faculty was nice enough to allow me to join even-though I had not registered. They had first-timers-ski-free offer as well which I missed! Anyway, the faculty was helping the inexperienced on the bunny hills in using the ropes, sliding, stopping, turning. They answered my questions, helped me get up, skied down the slope along with me, helped me tremendously in getting used to the rope (this was so difficult at first, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t go more than two feet) and were very cheerful. Now when I think of it, I liked the skiing experience because of their good faculty as well. Thumbs up for them. 👍\n  Scared\n   I was asked to be on the bunny hills for some more time but I took off as my friends were waiting for me to go to the next level - the maple syrup. It didn\u0026rsquo;t go quite well - I dropped my skis trying to get on the lift and had one of the faculty attach it to the shoes, I fell down getting off the lift, fell down at the first turn as I picked up speed. I fell down again before coming down. I tried that slope a couple of times and kept dropping the skis! I pity the lift operator who had to put it back on. 😟 He wasn\u0026rsquo;t complaining; he understood and kept giving me tips each time. I like Ski Brule. 😃\nNext slope was Homestead. Just looking at it scared the hell out of me. It was steep and had a sharp turn right after. I just turned left and stayed on maple the whole time. I declined the offer to join on other hills.\n   Acting Brave knowing pizza ;-)\n   Next day, after a couple of rounds of maple syrup, I graduated to homestead. Guess, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to tell you about how it went for a few times. But by noon, I was confident. I had to push myself to the limit to go on Timber Doodle when other group of friends called me. Thank god I did that because I loved it so much; it was awesome going down that terrain trail. I didn\u0026rsquo;t fall even once on that slippery surface, I even zigzagged between others (okay, I had to because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t control the speed!). I tried it again before moving on to other slopes. I tried all slopes except White Water and Double Doodle.\nOn last few slopes, I got company of Cynthia who kinda gave me the confidence to push the limit a bit more. Looking back now, I think, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have even tried them if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for her! On the last slope Big Bear, I caught some air on the small edge. Voila, I didn\u0026rsquo;t fall and got excited and a bit over confident too and picked up speed. BAM! Fell down so hard and my friend John stopped to check if I was ok. How was he supposed to know that I was only testing my helmet. 😁\nThat was the end of skiing; it left me wanting for more. The best of it all was that I walked into the chalet with approx. 15 strangers and walked out knowing how wonderful they all are. It was a trip filled with memories and will be one the most memorable among many to come.\n  Three of us on the slopes\n    50% of us on the slopes\n    Total cost (including food, stay, ski etc) was was around $150 - advantage of going in groups.\nSlope levels - (easy) Green, Blue, Black\n  Terrain map - Ski Brule\n   ","href":"/blog/a-ski-trip-to-ski-brule-michigan/","title":"A Ski Trip"},{"content":"Skiing is fun. As a beginner, it is something you will hate during but love afterward. If you have skied already, you\u0026rsquo;ll easily dismiss me, but if you have not then you\u0026rsquo;ll know what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong here, if you have never been skiing before and if you have a chance, just pack up and go. It is fun. It is as much fun to ski as it is pain as a beginner.\nIt is such a pain in the arse when you fall hard; it is embarrassing when you fall within 5 feet from where you started; it is embarrassing when you can\u0026rsquo;t get up; it\u0026rsquo;s a shame when you see 5 year old kids skiing like they are born to do it; same applies when you can\u0026rsquo;t walk (something you\u0026rsquo;ve to do).

I bet you won\u0026rsquo;t find a single skier who hasn\u0026rsquo;t faced the same issues that you do now. How do I know all this? Well, I skied this weekend for the first time. I fell, then I fell, and then I fell again; I skied backwards; I was confused, I was embarrassed, I was doubtful. I was grinning all along. Laughing at myself. But, somehow I knew it wasn\u0026rsquo;t gonna happen forever. I stood up, I listened, I watched others and most of all I tried again and again and again.

Those penny auction sites are amazing, aren\u0026rsquo;t they? The concept is so clear and it almost sounds like anyone can get one of those shiny new iPads, Macs, Nikkon D90, or Canon EOS 7D on auction just for a few pennies.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t got a clue about it, I urge you to read about them. READ ABOUT THEM. DO NOT JUMP INTO BIDDING! I mean, I\u0026rsquo;m just saying. If you want go ahead and spend some money; however, do not hold me responsible for any damage. I have already shouted at you. You are lucky that I warned you; It\u0026rsquo;s kind of sad that nobody warned me!\nCheck out the Google Trends for key word \u0026lsquo;penny auction\u0026rsquo; and you will find their recent surge in popularity.\nAre you wondering if I\u0026rsquo;m supporting the penny auction sites or not? Well, neither. It\u0026rsquo;s up to you to decide. My opinion is that they are not legit. Even if they are, to buy an item, one\u0026rsquo;d have to pay a lot more than what the item really costs. This is something similar to the Ponzi schemes in which unless you are the kingpin or his sidekicks, you will gain more frustration and hatred than money.\nThere might be a few lucky bastards (or maybe even paid actors!) but all of us are not, right? The companies might pick one winner here and there just to keep the excitement in the air. Even those luckiest few feel so tempted (after all they have won something for nothing) that they end up bidding and you-know-what-happens-next. The bidding is exciting, it is addictive, it\u0026rsquo;ll give you a high. The penny auction bidding is newly wed feeling whereas the ending is a feeling like that of a divorcee, although you lost, you know you are better off without.\nOkay, that\u0026rsquo;s all. If you still go ahead and lose a lot of money, please leave a comment on how does it feel to get gang-raped by a bunch of bots for the love of pennies.\nPS: I will post the \u0026lsquo;bots\u0026rsquo; that one can use on his/her computer to bid for an item when the timer reaches a second. No, that won\u0026rsquo;t guarantee you the item. Keep watching!\nMore on this and how to write scripts to hack(snipe) bidding can be found here.\n","href":"/blog/penny-auction-sites/","title":"Penny Auction Sites"},{"content":"I think, this is the first time I was out on the new year (January 1st 00:00:00 to be precise).

Just curious to know how many did the same. Hopefully someone will come up with the stats soon.\nI always use different passwords on different sites. All of them are at least 10+ character long with minimum one capital, special character, and number in it. Curious to know what my friends do, I brought up this topic briefly. After the discussion, I realized that even those who are into IT, IS, computers etc. use simple, stupid passwords. Most of them even create documents with the id, password combinations and store them on their desktop! Guess what, their systems are not even encrypted!!! When you tell them about the seriousness of the issue, they just look at me and say, \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not dealing with that important data here\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;nerd\u0026rsquo; or something similar.\nSomehow it reminds of a used 512GB hard-disk I bought off a street side shop in Bangalore. I found photos, videos (some were you-know-what) and some documents. One of the spreadsheet had a bunch of URLs, id, password combinations for sites ranging from social networking sites to financial websites. I never even tried any of them. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in any of them; the stuff on the hard-disk itself was enough entertainment! I never shared or distributed anything off that hard-disk. I formatted it and installed Ubuntu on it! I know that the data wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been erased during the formatting, but I\u0026rsquo;m quite sure that it would have been overwritten by now due to the usage.\nAnyway, I had changed all my passwords around two months ago. However, I was somehow restless and wanted to change the passwords to make it more complex on those few important sites. I kept postponing it for weeks until last weekend. I was not a victim of Gawker Media incident. I neither have an account with them, nor do I remember commenting on their sites. Nevertheless, when I got an email form them, I just stopped all work I was doing and immediately changed passwords on everything possible.\nI\u0026rsquo;m happy that I learnt a lesson or two from this incident. Most important of them all, do not create accounts on each and every site that you come across. If you really want to, create a dummy email and use that with a dummy id, password. You can use this on all nonsensical websites. If somebody cracks, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to give a damn.\nPlease note that no matter how strong a password you use, it all comes down to a few weak links such as the status of the machine you using (affected with malicious content, key-loggers etc.), the website you are dealing with (https - even https can be tricked or plain text transmission), the way the sites store and handle your data, how important you are to them etc. but the weakest link of all is YOU!\n","href":"/blog/password-change-identifying-the-weakest-link-in-the-chain/","title":"Password Change"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/security/","title":"security"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/introspect/","title":"introspect"},{"content":"A long weekend (four days) - many of my friends are on trips visiting places. I\u0026rsquo;m sitting here writing this post! I couldn\u0026rsquo;t go due to work. I had to work for a couple of hours exactly in the middle of the four days so I stayed back. It sure doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel good but not as bad as I imagined it to be. Almost 3/4th of the long weekend has gone by. It\u0026rsquo;s work and someone had to do it. Moreover, it\u0026rsquo;s because of work I\u0026rsquo;m here in US in the first place so no whining.\nI had plans to visit a friend of mine in Chicago but canceled due to you-know-what-by-now.\nThursday wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad. I had some invites from some friends here for Thanksgiving, but transportation was a problem. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a car and I feel awkward asking others to pick me up and drop. Anyway, completed some work, cooked nice food, talked to family back home for an hour, slept most of the time and before I knew it was already Friday, the black one. 😝\nTime flew by. Did some grocery shopping (the only time till now in this weekend I stepped out of my apartment!), browsing, \u0026lsquo;facebooking\u0026rsquo;. Called up a friend but she isn\u0026rsquo;t in town, another one didn\u0026rsquo;t pick up. Then, I dropped the idea of calling anyone. It\u0026rsquo;s uncomfortable for me to call up others, check what they are doing and if I can join them etc. Inviting and asking for an invite are two different things. Anyway, I completed some major portion of the work and was still working when the dawn broke! And as it happens, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get up until dusk.\nHere I am, again browsing, reading and catching up with the blogosphere after a along time. I have got some work left, it will take may be a couple of hours. Also, I have a huge list of TODOs. What started as a small note keeping as now become five fully grown TODO lists. I already got rid of one. I\u0026rsquo;ve a target of completing 90% of them by Monday.\nThough it is something I don\u0026rsquo;t prefer, believe me it wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad.

Though I was prepared for all of it, I was caught off guard with other stuff.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t collect all necessary documents until a day before the travel date. Packing was done just 4 hours before the departure time. I just went around the house and picked up all my stuff and stuffed it in the luggage bag. it weighed less than 35 pounds I guess. I had two luggage bags and a backpack which later I realized was a mistake to carry with.\nSujith, a cousin of mine, had come down to help which I should really appreciate. It was just 2 hours remaining and the Meru taxi guy was lost trying to find me. After a lot of byes, take-cares, hugs, I left.

In London, I sat down to have something from Pret A Manger. Rest of the time, I was roaming around; I was good enough to write a book on how to spend time at LHR that day. This is when I realized that the backpack was a mistake. Take my advice and buy a wheeled cabin baggage if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one already, you will thank me for that.\nAt Miami, the immigration check was smooth. No issues.

Today was my last day at Dance Verve. Remember this last paragraph? A week after that I joined Dance Verve at BTM Check Post.\nI remember the very first day - I entered the class when Taj Khan (we call him sir) was not yet in. I talked to two guys (now I know them - Pavan and Manas) and sir arrived in about 15 minutes. He asked to join right then as I introduced myself. Somehow I was still very nervous and said I\u0026rsquo;d join from the next day. I didn\u0026rsquo;t forget to mention that I had never danced before (of course Salsa apart) and I tried may times and failed miserably. I used to get very conscious. He just smiled and said, it will take sometime before I can dance and I should be regular.\nFor next couple of minutes I stood there watching all those who were dancing; I so wanted to join them right then, but could not. It was difficult. I left!\nNext day, I did join. Sir taught me how to do the \u0026ldquo;po\u0026rdquo; (oops, I\u0026rsquo;m confused po or bho or \u0026hellip;) kind of a pranam before starting the dance and again before leaving the class. No prize for guessing - I hardly moved that day! So it went on like that for 1-2 classes and then I slowly started. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that I dance good now or I have gotten rid of the conscious problem or anything, but I can assure you I\u0026rsquo;m 200% better than what I was when I joined the classes! I consider myself as the worst dancer that ever was in that dance class. I don\u0026rsquo;t care, I just loved it.\nSometimes on Monday I used to think about the class on Saturday 11AM the next week.

It was close to 2AM and the same auto came out from another side and stopped in front of the hospital which was some 50 meters from my place. When they left, we went to the hospital and asked the nurse about them. What she told us made it clear that guy wasn\u0026rsquo;t alone. One of the guy in the auto said that he had back pain, when he went in for the check up, other two were standing near the gate and noticing us! Then they left saying the pain is okayish.\n0200Hrs – I was totally pissed and left to watch the football match. South Africa lost to Uruguay 0-3. After the match I went to check what was happening. It was 2AM - I noticed someone walking alone. When he neared, I called him and asked him who he was and where he was going at that time. First he looked a little agitated, when I made sure he noticed the log in my hand, he softened and said he was returning home after work.

I let him go.\nSomeone there called A and he was at this place which is very close to where he started - his native. He informed that he didn\u0026rsquo;t have a vehicle and was waiting for the bus for more than half an hour. He then called one of his acquaintance who stayed close and got his vehicle. Another 2 hours of wait!\nThose who had gathered were interrogating V – who was behind the shutter. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe that we hadn\u0026rsquo;t called the cops yet. I started listening to V. By that time he might have thought that there won\u0026rsquo;t be any police as everyone was discussing why they don\u0026rsquo;t want the police to come etc.\nV agreed that he had got the keys duplicated the day before. He had taken the keys from the shop at 11AM, got duplicates made and dropped the original back at around 1PM. However, he didn\u0026rsquo;t agree on the theft on Tuesday. Hearing that my dad got totally pissed about A\u0026rsquo;s negligence. He hadn\u0026rsquo;t changed the keys in spite of my Dad asking him to do so.\nDad called up A and shouted at him and warned him that if he doesn\u0026rsquo;t come by 4AM, he would let the thief go!!! Bro had to explain that the place was far, they didn\u0026rsquo;t have any vehicle, and it was a very cold night and driving at night is a tough task altogether.\nI made another attempt in vain at making them realize that the police should have been involved. Now, it was like \u0026lsquo;we have already waited for such a long time, lets wait for A to come and take care of it himself!\u0026rsquo; I could have called the cops but you know that \u0026lsquo;I told you not to call them and see now what happened\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;children don\u0026rsquo;t listen to their parents\u0026rsquo; and other melodramatic scenes later.\n0345Hrs – A arrived. He instantly recognized V by his voice. V had been coming to the shop for 3-4 days now and made all the attempts at developing a healthy acquaintance. Finally it was time to get the thief out of the shop. It was dangerous, he might injure someone and run away. No one listened to me.\nI asked them to open the shutter only a foot off the ground so that he can be caught easily. That was the only thing they listened from me that night! V was extremely calm. Before coming out he said, hit me anywhere but not on the head unless you want to see yourself in the police station! Some people gathered beat him up; at the same time, Dad and I snatched the logs and other stuff from some people sensing it could get out of hand!\nHe was tied to a post nearby and some people started hitting him again. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see it; It was awful. I looked at my dad, even he couldn\u0026rsquo;t take it. I had enough; I shouted, \u0026lsquo;see, you want that man to die? Either you call the police now or I will let him go.\u0026rsquo; Mom forced him to make the call. Finally he called up the police from the land line phone. Meanwhile Mom and I were shouting at others who were very eager to show of their fighting skills on a tied up man.\nI felt so bad for that guy. I scolded him for doing such things and asked him to earn for his living the right way. He was a healthy man; he didn\u0026rsquo;t utter a word during all this thrashing! V mentioned that his wife was a heart patient and he was badly in need of money! I wanted to tell him to rob some rich place instead of these kind of shops where he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get more than a couple of thousands, but did not.\nPolice arrived in 10 minutes and after checking the place, getting some information from us, they took him away.\nSome relief. Dad was furious. It showed in the way he was talking to A about his carelessness, not heeding his advice on using new locks etc\u0026hellip;\n0430Hrs – Everyone dispersed. I asked Dad, \u0026lsquo;isn\u0026rsquo;t that what I asked you to do at 12AM itself?\u0026rsquo; His reply, \u0026lsquo;wait and you will see. I will have to run around police station, court because of you.\u0026rsquo; There was no point talking to him. He was influenced by these people who had gathered!\n Later I found out that it is 080-100 to call the police from the cell phone! How stupid of me not to realize it at that time.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a couple of days now, police had come once to collect some info, yesterday they informed that there was a group behind it and they will be producing him in front of the magistrate the next day.\nThe locks have been replaced now. I have informed everyone to be very careful. These people (if they were more than one) might come back to take revenge!!! You never know.\nA found a phone book, pictures of V\u0026rsquo;s wife and kids etc. in the shop. I don\u0026rsquo;t think a pro thief would carry all that on the job.\nThough we act tough, we were/are very soft when it came to violence. Dad, Mom, and I – none of us could stand that guy getting beaten. It\u0026rsquo;s been two days and mom still keeps saying, \u0026lsquo;poor chap. I don\u0026rsquo;t think he is a regular. He might be in real trouble in life or else he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t come to steal from here.\u0026rsquo; And Dad - \u0026lsquo;I curse myself for locking up that guy. I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have woken up to switch off the motor. He would have took whatever money was there and gone!\u0026rsquo;\nI think, it was right thing to catch him, but he should have been handed over to the police immediately. Anyway, bygone is bygone. Everybody gets what they deserve.\n Lastly, there was something about V\u0026rsquo;s calmness. He never lost it. Closing it with this little conversation.\n  Police :  was it you on Tuesday?   V :  No   Police :  it wasn\u0026rsquo;t you?   V :  No, I came yesterday.   Police :  (angrily) Just now you said you didn\u0026rsquo;t. Tell the truth.   V :  Sir, it is already past midnight and is Thursday. I came here yesterday that is Wednesday. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about the day before yesterday!    You should have seen the look on people\u0026rsquo;s face. I almost laughed out loud.\n","href":"/blog/a-planned-visit-gone-wrong/","title":"A Planned Visit Gone Wrong"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/bangalore/","title":"Bangalore"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/mob/","title":"mob"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/police/","title":"police"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/theft/","title":"theft"},{"content":"  Keep the ingredients ready\n   I wanted to show off my culinary skill (if I have any 😛) the other day when I made a chicken dish, unfortunately, I forgot to post it.

The previous day night I set alarm for 6, 6:10, 6:15AM. My usual pattern even after which I don\u0026rsquo;t wake up! I slept through all three alarms and woke up when Mom called me to wish me at 7AM. The cab guy also called at the same time. Cleverly, I had ironed clothes and arranged documents in Bangalore itself; I got ready in just about 15 minutes.\nWas it my passport?\nI reached consulate by 8AM and stood in the queue. I paid 300 rupees for the cab which I later found out is twice the usual amount. At the first counter on the road, the guy checked my passport and the invite letter. He looked at the passport and then at me. Again he looked at the passport and me. Then third time he smiled a bit, I put up an anxious smile. For a moment I thought I got my brother\u0026rsquo;s or dad\u0026rsquo;s passport, then I realised it was the photo. When he looked at me for the fourth time, I grinned; he smiled(it was more like laughing) and gave me the passport and put a seal on the invite letter. I look very different in the that 2006 photo; many have told me to change the photo unless I want to be detained at the airport. 😛\nThen it was the security check inside, document verification, and finger printing. I had got a small cut on the right thumb the previous day while traveling from Mylapur to Adyar. The person at the counter stared at the thumb impression for a little too long but let me go and join the queue. The doctor certificate I got for the permanent mark on one of my fingers proved to be a waste of time and effort, he didn\u0026rsquo;t bother to ask.\nI was in the queue; the lady in front and the gentleman behind me were from the same company. I was noticing the interview and the interviewer. She asked a few questions to one person and then she didn\u0026rsquo;t ask much to the next two. This pattern repeated. I silently calculated – if the pattern were to continue, the girl in front of me would get the questions and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t. Guess what, she was asked a few questions. It was my turn -\n  Me :  Good morning.   Interviewer :  Good morning. Pass me the documents please.   Me :  here they are.    At this point she turned to her computer and started entering something. I was thinking if she would ask any question. After may be a minute -\n  Interviewer :  which client?   Me :  *client name*   Interviewer :  what is your highest degree?   Me :  Bachelor of Engineering.   Interviewer :  specialisation?   Me :  Information Science and Engineering.   Interviewer :  Please place your middle finger on the scanner.   Me :  oh\u0026hellip; hmmm\u0026hellip; this one?(showing index finger as I didn\u0026rsquo;t hear her clearly)   Interviewer :  this one.(showing middle finger)   Me :  okay(showing middle finger. I suppressed laughter. It was odd and funny. 😃 )   Interviewer :  Your visa is approved and you would get it in four to five days. You may go now.   Me :  Thank you. Have a nice day ahead.   Interviewer :  Thank you.    I took a cab back to guest house on sharing basis and it cost only 150 Rupees!!! Though my employer was paying the expenses, I called up the morning cab and they said 270 Rupees was their minimum charge. Don\u0026rsquo;t ever take MTT(Madrastravels) if you can find some local taxi unless they offer you a free ride.\nBy 9AM, I was back home and had breakfast. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t plan for the rest of the day as I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a computer to surf and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any Internet cafe around. Movie was the best option, so I called up my friends in Chennai/Bangalore and enquired about any place showing Iron Man – 2 in Chennai. Sadly, there were none. The weather that day was very nice, which I realised a day later, due to cyclone Laila.\nI went to Spencer Plaza on Mount Road and roamed around for an hour, had lunch there and on my way back bought a shirt for my Dad for his birthday. I wanted to buy a saree, but looking at the way I was dressed (in shorts, tight t-shirt, earring and stuff), the price went up; I dropped the idea of buying a saree and headed to guest-house.\nBack at guest house, I packed everything; flight was at 9PM and I had to leave the place by 7:30PM at least. It looked as if it\u0026rsquo;d rain heavily, so I dropped the plan of going to the beach; I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have dropped it if I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a flight to catch. The damned TV was showing only a few channels. I found a set-top box, connected it to the socket on the opposite wall. After rearranging the furniture and tapping the box a few times, I was able to get it working. Next few hours were gone in surfing through the channels.\nI still had three hours to kill, so I made plans to have a few drinks and set out in search. I swear, that place sucked; I didn\u0026rsquo;t find a single decent place. All I could find was two shops where you can just buy and if you want you can have it right there on the road, standing with lungi over your head! I walked for another few minutes and found another shop which was worst than the others I had found earlier. I could have taken an auto to some decent place, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t desperate enough.\nI had to head back as it started drizzling. I reached Chinnamalai, that circle near little mount. From a roadside shop I had a vada, a banana bajji, a tea, and then a coffee! It was a wonderful esp. in the rain.\nFrom there I went straight to guest-house and took bath for the fourth time that day. At 7:30PM the cab arrived; I checked out; thanked the guest-house caretaker, watchman, my room-mate(for the previous post). I was at Chennai airport at 8PM; Bangalore airport by 9:45PM and home by 11PM. The cab driver on the way back was dozing at the wheels; he stopped at some place and washed his face with cold water. Thank god he didn\u0026rsquo;t bang his car somewhere; I paid him some nice tip for the same. 😬\nI was happy with the way things turned out that day and went to bed. It was a very cold night thanks to Laila and I was way too exhausted.\n","href":"/blog/my-h1b-visa-stamping-saga-part-ii/","title":"My H1B Visa Stamping Saga - Part II"},{"content":"My H1B visa was approved in December 2009 and finally, I got to get it stamped on 18th May 2010. I had arranged all documents by last Thursday and booked air tickets to Chennai. I had never travelled by air before; it was going to be my first time. 😃\nMonday morning I got a call from the cab driver who was lost trying to find me! After around 6-7 call and giving him directions, he finally made it. Travel to airport took nearly 1.5 hours and there was never a boring moment; he was more talkative than I\u0026rsquo;m.\nOnce at airport, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to do. I asked at one of the counter outside and the person at the counter asked me to get in first! I wasn\u0026rsquo;t not even inside the airport. After the first security check, I went directly to the Kingfisher counter which I had spotted from outside.\nLady at the counter asked,\n  Lady :  \u0026lsquo;Sir, which seat do you prefer?\u0026rsquo;   Me :  \u0026lsquo;The one next to the pilot\u0026rsquo;, I replied.   Lady :  \u0026lsquo;That seat is not available sir\u0026rsquo;   Me :  \u0026lsquo;ok, in that case I do not mind any seat\u0026rsquo;    She asked me to go upstairs for security check through gate 10. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the gate and just went to and joined a queue and put my bag on the small conveyor belt and stood in the queue to be frisked. Just before the guard asked me to step forward, I read a board which said I should put the cell-phones on the belt too. I dropped my cell on one of the laptop which was going in.\nOnce at the other side with my bag and cell, I realised where gate 10 was. I was supposed to go to gate 10 only after the security check. The flight had arrived and I had an hour to kill. I had got an SMS from Kingfisher requesting me to come 2 hours before time, duh! I was happy not to heed their request. I had a coffee at the Barista, which I didn\u0026rsquo;t like; CCD is much better. Finally, they let us through. A bus dropped us near the flight. It was a nice experience esp. when the flight took off. I was staring outside the window and for a moment I felt that we are not moving at all! 😃\nThe flight landed in Chennai at 11:30AM, I took a cab to Srinagar Colony. Nobody was around other than the caretaker. After getting fresh and realising that there is no food there, I took a walk outside to find some place to eat. I must tell you, it sucked. It is hot as hell outside and I was not able to find any place. At last I found a hotel on Little Mount road and a heavy meal. I came back to guest house and couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but fall asleep while watching TV.\nI had plans to go to City Center and watch \u0026lsquo;How to Tame your Dragon\u0026rsquo; at 4:30PM. I had no plans of sleeping in the afternoon in the first place, I woke up just before 4PM and rushed out just find myself in a unknown place, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know where the bus stand was. Thankfully, I found a Blue Dart guy and asked him for directions. He was kind enough to drop me to the nearest bus stop. He put me ahead of 21M/G and asked me to board it. It was really nice of him.\nI got down right in front of the mall. Visit to INOX was eventful too. I paid 500 Rupees and got a ticket and 180 Rupees back. I was under the impression that they had taken 200 Rupees for the 3D goggles. The person who was giving the goggles asked me for 150 Rupees which was refundable. I went back to the counter and got my 200 Rupees from her and paid 150 Rupees for the goggles and by the time I entered the place it was already more than 10 minutes late.\nThere was a couple sitting to my right. After I started counting, she said \u0026lsquo;oh. sooo sweeet\u0026rsquo; 17 times. I was having corn, missing the sweets, and this person comes to me and says I have taken his seat. In fact I had! During intermission I sat on J15 instead of I15. By the time I came back to I15, I missed a scene where our little hero tames the first dragon. I sighed, \u0026lsquo;fuck man, I missed it\u0026rsquo;. I got a stare from the sweety and that was the last time I heard \u0026lsquo;Oh, so sweeet\u0026rsquo; from her! LOL\nThe movie was interesting and what followed after was too. I was lost. I took 21G and the bus conductor says it doesn\u0026rsquo;t go to Srinagar and he asked me to take another 21G after getting down at Mylapur. Two ladies sitting behind giggle, \u0026lsquo;Mylapur - bas mahilaayein rehti hain kya wahan?\u0026rsquo; ( \u0026lsquo;only women stay there, is it?\u0026rsquo; Mylapur sounds like Mahilapur and in Hindi, Mahila means woman) These women were from Delhi and they were lost as I was.\nI got down at Mylapur and asked nearly 15 buses. No bus would go to Srinagar colony. Most of them didn\u0026rsquo;t even know where it is. One fellow waiting at the bus stop asked me to take 5B bus. Then it hit me, the Blue Dart guy had dropped me some place where I got 21M/G. That\u0026rsquo;s why no 21M/G goes to Srinagar! I had seen a court near the guest house and asked a bus conductor about it; he asked me to get down at Adyar gate. From there I walked around half a kilometer, past some Defence building, Temple tower, BHEL, fire station, and got 29L bus to Saidapet Court. I asked the conductor of the bus about the name of this place. It was Chinnamalai - near little mount road. I got back to guest house at around 8PM; my room-mate was already back. I got fresh, arranged the documents in order, ironed clothes, booked cab for tomorrow.\nNow, as I type this I\u0026rsquo;m chatting with my room-mate and this is his laptop.

I was in need of timer to mark an important decision; I did what most of us would do - search on the internet. I found quite a few of them, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t like any of them. Some of them were unnecessarily complicated; a couple of others weren\u0026rsquo;t easily understandable; most of them were using approximation (esp. for months and years).\nMy requirement was that the timer should be simple and which counts time exactly the same way we humans do. So I decided to write one myself. Before going into the details, I wanted it for my homepage.\nJavaScript CountUp Timer This script is very simple; it takes a date to count the time from, an ID to put the timer. It is also possible to have more than one timer on a page - check the demo link given at the end of this post.\nJavaScript CountUp Timer v2.0\n/********************************************************************************************** # MIT License # # Copyright (c) 2010 Praveen Lobo (praveenlobo.com) # # Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy # of this software and associated documentation files (the \u0026#34;Software\u0026#34;), to deal # in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights # to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell # copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is # furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: # # The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all # copies or substantial portions of the Software. # # THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u0026#34;AS IS\u0026#34;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR # IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, # FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Initially I had slightly different idea to update the counter every second. Though it seemed to work fine, I could think of a case where it would break. numOfDays[] is set initially when the timer starts. If the browser is kept open for a long time (really long time!), numOfDays[1] could become invalid. This could have been fixed easily in v1.0 itself, but I rewrote it to make it even simpler.\nI have created a page to demonstrate the timer - demo\nI also built a count up timer that uses approximation to calculate units. In this counter each unit is independent of the other. Please see countupunits.js and countupunits-demo.html\nIn case of any issues/doubts/suggestions or you just want to appreciate :o), feel free to leave a comment.\nJavaScript CountUp Timer v1.0\n/********************************************************************************************** # MIT License # # Copyright (c) 2010 Praveen Lobo (praveenlobo.com) # # Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy # of this software and associated documentation files (the \u0026#34;Software\u0026#34;), to deal # in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights # to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell # copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is # furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: # # The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all # copies or substantial portions of the Software. # # THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u0026#34;AS IS\u0026#34;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR # IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, # FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

For the initial four or five years it was more or less like two or three cigarettes a year, so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a smoker then by any standard. :o) However, I really started smoking nearly three years ago.\nI have been on and off at it. I quit smoking for a couple of months a couple of times in these three years. The longest period was around six months. I was very convinced that I\u0026rsquo;d never smoke again until one day, in late 2009, when a friend of mine asked me to accompany him to the smoking area (Anna shop next to Infosys Mangalore DC). Unfortunately, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t refuse when he offered me a cigarette. After that there was no looking back, I had on an average one a day!\nEvery time I used to smoke, I used to convince myself that it would be the last one and the very next day I\u0026rsquo;d tell to myself, \u0026lsquo;I will just have one more and then I will never touch one again!\u0026rsquo; The just-one-more feeling is the worst enemy; it never goes away!\nI have made promises to quit smoking quite a few times, but somehow I end up breaking the promises. I have realised that trying to quit just because I have made a promise to someone is not going to work. It will help, but it is not sufficient. If something goes wrong between us or if that person hurts me, it will be like, \u0026lsquo;fuck the promise, I don\u0026rsquo;t give a damn!\u0026rsquo; If I have to quit, it must come from within.\nI had been thinking about it for sometime now. I chose a date to quit smoking. I decided that April 4th, 2010 (Easter as well!) would be the last day. I did have a smoke today and as soon as I put it down, I noted down the time. It was April 4th, 2010 01:11:20 PM IST - the last time I ever had a cigarette. EVER.\nBonus: To celebrate this event and to let everyone know, I have created a count-up timer (it is on my homepage as well)\n","href":"/blog/quit-smoking/","title":"Quit Smoking"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/smoking/","title":"smoking"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/bbmp/","title":"BBMP"},{"content":"BBMP elections are scheduled for tomorrow.

This limit is sufficient only for usual surfing. 500C+ plan also gives me night unlimited option i.e. the data transferred between 2AM to 8AM is not counted towards the 2.5GB quota per month. I can download around 4GB in this time frame. I use this time to download contents, but the real problem is starting the download at 2AM.\nThere are a lot of discussions out there which suggests that the modem should be rebooted at 2AM to avoid the data transferred after 2AM getting billed. You will also get a lot of scripts and tools do this for you. Combining this with scheduling capabilities of download managers and torrents should solve the issue. I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried any of this though. Once I started the download and turned off the modem immediately; I got up at 2AM to turn on the modem! This was really a pain. I never downloaded anything after that.\nRecently, I realised that rebooting the modem is not required at all; however, the download should be started after 2AM. I could simply try torrent client to do that but the restriction of using torrent clients is that one cannot download content directly from website(right?); it is P2P.\nA SOLUTION To overcome this, I created a small utility script called swget- a simple wget wrapper to download contents from multiple URLs esp. for BSNL night unlimited users.

It doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop downloads at 8AM. If you have a large file you\u0026rsquo;d have to take care of stopping the download at 8AM. Also, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if the incomplete downloads are resumed. By default wget command resumes incomplete downloads but I have not tested it.\nALTERNATIVES Though the aforementioned solution works, there is a much simpler way of doing the same using cron. Just register the below command, using crontab -e command, in your cron.\n5 2 * * * wget -nc -nv -w 10 -i URLFile -a LogFile -P DownloadFolder If the system is on, the wget command runs at 2:05AM every day and downloads the content from URLs mentioned in the URLFile to DownloadFolder. There is no need to delete this from cron once the download is complete; however, the URLFile needs to be cleaned up so that when the job runs again at next 2:05AM, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t download anything.\nThe beauty of this approach is that I can just put the URLs in URLFile as and when I get them and leave the system turned on at the end of the day to get the contents downloaded. However, I see a problem with this approach - if I decide to download something after 2:05AM, I would have run the wget command explicitly since the cron job runs exactly once at 2:05AM everyday. It goes without saying that even this approach doesn\u0026rsquo;t take care of 8:00AM deadline. I can either stop the download manually or add another job to shutdown the system at 8:00AM!\nThanks for reading it till the end!

BSNL 500C+ is best for me! ;o)\n _Update (2010-05-27):_ The above methods don't work for torrents, here is a [solution](/blog/automate-torrent-download-using-transmission).

It oscillated between okay to bad, bad to worse, and back to okay and then to good. First two days were uneventful and I had no clue of what lie ahead.\nWednesday was the beginning. Firstly, a brand new system welcomed me to office on Wednesday morning; they had formatted my machine without any kind of confirmation. Secondly, two priority-one production issues on Thursday and some actions taken to resolve the issues came back on Friday as a different issue. To top it all, I had to deal with it using a newly installed operating system. No links, no data, no mail archives, and no software. Only notepad and the damned communicator which kept pissing me off! This whole thing happened in the same week in which I failed in a certification, which I\u0026rsquo;m not worried about, and a written test.\nHowever, I did get some appreciation for handling the situation, but I\u0026rsquo;d have liked it more if they had understood and appreciated how difficult it was to do it with none of the required software. Another good news is that I cleared the written test last week itself in the second attempt. There was a different invigilator that day. He gave me the same topic and I wrote the exact same essay; however, keeping the review comments in mind. I cleared!\nThe weekend was quite eventful as well. I wrote a small bash script to download contents after 2AM. It was actually not needed, but it was long time I did something technical in my free time. I painted lord Ganesha on glass; glass painting is fun especially when you steal the materials from your brother and later act as if you are gifting him the painting. :o)\nI found out some dance and music academies around my area; none amongst them are starting drums classes immediately, which is kind of sad. I might join freestyle dance classes from next week! My heart was in my mouth when I walked into the dance academies. In fact, even now, thinking about it feels no better, but I want to do it. I want to get over the inhibitions. There is a good chance that I might not join. Let me see how it goes.\nPS: Please let me know if you are aware of any good schools that teach drums and freestyle dance nearby Jayadeva Hospital/JP Nagar/BTM.\n","href":"/blog/a-week-that-was/","title":"A Week That Was"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/p1/","title":"P1"},{"content":"You can find a few ways to connect with me at the bottom of every page on this site.\n Facebook - I\u0026rsquo;m not an active user and will not add people unless it is family or close friends.

Stirs up a lot of feeling. The first city, other than Bangalore, where I spent more than a year, the city where I lived independently, the city where I gained financial independence, the city where I started watching movies (for real!), the city which has given me a few best friends, the city where I fell in love\u0026hellip; I have so many fond memories of this city that I could go on and on and on. But this post is about my visit to Mangalore last weekend.\nI had been to Mangalore for the first time since I moved to Bangalore in last July(2009). Surekha had been insisting for quite some time and her brother\u0026rsquo;s engagement came at the right time.\nIt started off with the ticket booking. There were no train tickets available and I had to book a bus ticket. I booked KSRTC AIRAVAT Volvo bus ticket to Mangalore starting on 26th February. I was confused about the timing when my colleague suggested that I pick the bus which leaves last and told me that I\u0026rsquo;d definitely be late. In fact, he was right; by the time I left office it was well past 8PM. My bus was at 11PM. I didn\u0026rsquo;t forget to book a train ticket for return journey but it was on waiting list(WL#15).\n26th February 2010 I reached Majestic just 5 minutes before the departure time. I called up Sreeja and Sushanth from the bus; Sreeja was in another train to Kerala and Sushanth was too drunk to even pick up the call! The journey was good. It was far better than I anticipated it to be! I had traveled in Volvo only once before while traveling from Mysore to Mangalore (the very first time to Mangalore back in 2006) and it was suffocating. This time I felt it was quite good, in fact, I cursed myself for traveling by private sleeper buses between Bangalore and Mangalore for last three odd years. The Volvo takes just about half the time it takes in private buses and is very comfortable.\n27th February 2010 After reaching Mangalore, I went straight to a saloon and messaged Sunil. As soon as I came out of the saloon, Sunil was there on his bike! We went to his flat where I lived for about two years along with Sainath and Sunil until Sunil got married, bought the flat and kicked me out. There she was - Madam Surekha. I must tell you Sunil and Surekha are very dear to me! If you ask me what I miss most from Mangalore, my answer would definitely be\u0026hellip; :o)\nI was the atithi and the hosts had prepared Puri-bhaji. ;o) It was nice; I gulped, I think, around 6 puris :D Sunil suggested that we join Vijesh and his colleagues, who had come down from Bangalore to attend his engagement, on a trip in and around Mangalore. Only five could fit in the car and it was decided that Surekha would drop out.\nWe started from Mangalore around 10AM in Wagon R. We visited Thousand Pillars Jain Temple in Moodabidri, followed by Shri Annapoorneshwari Temple at Hosanadu Kodyadka in Moodbidri. This temple has a 61-feet Hanuman statue, an elephant and a few deers. This was the second time I visited these two temples. I had come here to Kodyadka with Surekha and her parents before in the same Wagon R. She is very fond of this temple.\n  Hanuman Gundi Waterfalls\n   Next destination was Madhuraa hotel at Karkala. After having lunch there, we went to Sunil\u0026rsquo;s house in Karkala – his native place. After an hour or so, we left to Hanumangundi waterfalls.\n  Hanuman Gundi Waterfalls\n   I really wanted to dive into the water but I had gone there unprepared and decided not to. The path leading to the falls is very steep, climbing your way up could be a tough task. We then stopped for the sunset at Hejmadi beach. Unlike Panambur beach, this one was very quite and there were very few people.\n  Praveen Lobo at Hejmadi Beach\n    Sunset at Hejmadi Beach\n   I somehow like the sunsets in pictures than in real life unless I\u0026rsquo;m walking hand in hand with a girl! :o)\nI can say, Sunil and I, both were missing Surekha. We came back at around 7:30PM and went to Cherry Square for dinner with her. Some like it hot is a must have if you ever visit Cherry Square.\nThat was it, the end of the first day. Not to forget, I also met Sainath and Rupesh, my roommates in Mars #606 along with Siddarth during my stay in Mangalore. They were vacating Mars 606, I visited it probably for the last time. I have fond memories of M606. The best thing about this place, apart from room-mates, was that I could see the ocean from my bed and many a times I used to wake up in the middle of the night, sit up and gaze at the ships.\n28th February 2010 The day of the engagement! I had breakfast at Surekha\u0026rsquo;s parent\u0026rsquo;s place. I had plans to meet Divya along with Sai, but both were busy studying for an exam. What has this world come to\u0026hellip;exams take priority!! 😛 I was at home while their (Sunil \u0026amp; Surekha\u0026rsquo;s) relatives started coming home and had nice time knowing them and interacting with them. There were even talks of finding a suitable bride for me. One of the aunt, who is a doctor by profession, mentioned that she knows quite some girls and asked if I\u0026rsquo;m interested. Before I could say something, Satish uncle said, \u0026ldquo;only if the delivery is free!\u0026rdquo; Everyone burst into laughter.\nThe ceremony started at 4:15PM in th evening in CBOO hall near PVS circle. I met a few colleagues from Mangalore along with Shilpa, Ravi, and their beautiful daughter Shreya. Flying kisses from Shriya were awesome. I really liked the Set-Dosa served there and got it twice. I had tea twice; taking the total count to 6 cups of tea for that day.\nAfter the ceremony, Vandana, Vijesh\u0026rsquo;s would-be, had come home. We had a nice chat and the best part of it was she supporting Karkala. \u0026lsquo;I like Mangalore but I like Karkala a bit more.\u0026rsquo; Surekha has to find someone who likes Mangalore to make it even (2-2) LOL.\nAfter dinner at aunt\u0026rsquo;s place, we came back to Sunil\u0026rsquo;s flat. Surekha slept early; Sunil and I were talking past midnight.\nThe day was perfect in all sense except the spelling on the board which read, “Engeagment: Vijesh with Vandana”\n1st March 2010 It was Monday and we had taken a day off. It feels wonderful to sleep till 9AM on a Monday morning. After the breakfast we went to aunt\u0026rsquo;s place. Surekha wanted to watch Karthik Calling Karthik. Initially we decided that we go to 1PM show but Sunil was somewhat reluctant in the end; we had launch at home and left to Big Cinema in Bharath Mall. We were around 15 minutes late. It was a ~2 hour movie and it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hurt even if you go 2 hour late to the movie, it will save some torture I promise. Such a crappy movie! Sunil slept during the movie, so did I.\nAfter the movie we went to Hotel Ayodhya (which featured on Highway on My Plate on NDTV Goodtimes) and to a roadside panipuri vendor.\nI then went to Infosys Mangalore DC to meet friends. I met Sreeja, Sushanth, Sushanth Mohan, Janaky, Jaykumar, Sandeep Shetty, Bikramjit Saha, Manjunath T, Pulkit, Arun Menon, Samir, Steephen et all. Divya wasn\u0026rsquo;t around this time as well; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t meet her before I left Mangalore in July 2009, yesterday as well as today. Her bad luck. 😉\nI met Neeti on my way back from office. She had come down form Meerut that day and couldn\u0026rsquo;t come to office. I kept my promise by meeting her when I was in Mangalore but she couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep her promise of making yummy Maggie noodles and custard for me. She was very tired and I could meet her only for a couple of minutes. I\u0026rsquo;m sure she would have kept her words if we had time. It was lovely seeing her - such a sweetheart she is.\nMom had called twice to inform me about violence in Shivamoga and Hassan over an article published in the local newspaper. Meanwhile Sunil had called to inform that train ticket was not confirmed. The status was WaitingList#1 and the chart had been prepared. We went to KSRTC to get bus ticket; only last row tickets were available. While we were thinking what to do, a person came to the counter to cancel his ticket. I grabbed the ticket from him - seat #15.\nBack at home, I packed everything and after dinner waved goodbye to everyone. The joy of getting #15 didn\u0026rsquo;t live long, At the KSRTC bus stand, they had cancelled my 10:29PM Volvo due to clashes in Hassan and put the passengers of that bus in some other Volvo bus which had around 20 reservations. I ended up getting #35.\n2nd March 2010 The return trip was quite okay but I got knee pain in the end. I was at home by 7:30AM and I slept the whole day. Complete day was wasted except that I wrote a recommendation, got two calls from work, and wrote this.\nLast three days were among those days which would remain afresh in my memories. It was lovely esp. because of Sunil, Surekha, and their family. I sent her an SMS after from the bus that read \u0026ldquo;If your parents are looking to adopt, please suggest me.\u0026rdquo;\nPhoto courtesy - Mallya\n","href":"/blog/a-weekend-in-mangalore/","title":"A Weekend In Mangalore"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/mangalore/","title":"Mangalore"},{"content":"I have come across a lot of comments, communications, posts, and people (even my Dad and Bro) where they mention how they hated a Pakistani cricketer(Saeed Anwar) holding the record for highest ODI runs in a match.

Yeah, why not? After all It\u0026rsquo;s the OS that made one man the richest in the world. It\u0026rsquo;s the OS that has made so many people across the globe dedicate their own resources and time to better it. It\u0026rsquo;s the OS that makes people argue - be it MS vs Linux or different distributions of Linux itself!\nI\u0026rsquo;m not a Linux freak or a guru but an average user helping the open source in a way that most of the people do - by using it! I have been using a personal computer since 2004 and have been using Fedora Core for more than 95% of my personal use. I have tried a lot of different flavours of Linux but no clue why I stuck to Fedora all this time. No, I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that it is bad; I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been using it for such a long time if it was, right? Fedora rocks but I just got bored of it!\n Bbye Fedora. Welcome Ubuntu!\n I assembled a system for myself with a brand new 500GB SATA hard disk and installed Ubuntu 9.10 - Karmic Koala this week. Since then I have been setting up the system, organising my data, adding new apps, removing apps which I will not use, exploring the difference between the apps I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with and those which came bundled together with Ubuntu etc.\n simplify(OS); /* OS is too easy to complicate! */\n One thing I have decided to do with my OS is to KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid. No more adding/trying each and every app that I come across. No, I have not and will not install KDE as well. I don\u0026rsquo;t need two different applications to do the same thing. I will stick to applications with bare minimum features that enable me to complete my job.\nUbuntu is a refreshing change from my long term companion Fedora though I haven\u0026rsquo;t found much of a difference between the two. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to learn a lot of new things and I sure hope Ubuntu and 2010 will bring many such opportunities.\nWish you a very happy and prosperous new year ahead.
