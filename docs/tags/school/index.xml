      <description>As a kid I was jealous of my brother, my cousin, and all my friends (who knew how to ride a bicycle). I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to ride a bike until I was thirteen or fourteen I think. My mom was too scared to allow me to ride a bicycle. I&amp;rsquo;d lie to mom and go trying to ride a bike instead of playing. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember anyone helping me how to ride.</description>

      <description>Last weekend, I had one of my friend come over from Chicago. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t met him in nearly 6-7 years until a couple of days ago when I met him Chicago. We went skydiving, and visited Lake Geneva and had good time together. Meeting him brought back many memories from my childhood and school days and inspired me to write. I think, it&amp;rsquo;s time to share and put them down here before they are completely erased from my already weak memories.</description>

      <description>Krishnamurthy. He is my oldest friend. We were in same class in Bangalore for six years starting 1990 before I had to leave. We were not in touch and had not met more than a handful of times in the last fifteen years. Then when I met him, he was still the same! He had moved to a new place and before I knew it, he was gone from there. I tried to find him but in vain.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m feeling nostalgic today. Very much. I had lot of time at my hand and decided to clean up my cupboard, which I do from time to time. Until a few years back, I used to keep all things I used to have during my childhood days and one day I decided to get rid of all the junk. First time I did it, believe me, it was so painful. Each small item had so many memories associated with it, but I had to clean up stuff.</description>
