Indians are the world champions! Yeah, say that again, WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember &amp;ldquo;More than a billion hearts and one shared dream&amp;rdquo;? That&amp;rsquo;s what I &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/blog/2011-world-cup-men-in-blue-will-rock-the-world/">wrote&lt;/a> when the world cup started. That dream has come true! Now more than 50% of Indian population can proudly say they saw their captain lift the world cup at least once in their life. Glory!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I dedicated the &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/index_archive/index_002.html">homepage&lt;/a> to Green Bay Packers and they won the super bowl; they are the Champions!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2011 World Cup</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/2011-world-cup-men-in-blue-will-rock-the-world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2011 06:27:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/2011-world-cup-men-in-blue-will-rock-the-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>My dear fellow Indians and everyone,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember 1983 Prudential world cup? Remember Captain Kapil Dev&amp;rsquo;s greatest catch that dethroned King Viv? No? Neither do I! It&amp;rsquo;s been 28 years since our captain lifted the cricket world cup. Not just me, nearly 50% of the current Indian population wasn&amp;rsquo;t even born back then!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More than a billion hearts and one shared dream, to see the men in blue lift the 2011 cricket world cup. Will it come true this time? Let us hope so.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Green Bay Packer on my Homepage</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/green-bay-packer-on-my-homepage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2011 07:59:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/green-bay-packer-on-my-homepage/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello world,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I dedicated my &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/index_archive/index_002.html">homepage&lt;/a> for Green Bay Packers on 6th February, 2011 and what they got me the same day?! THE SUPER BOWL!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s hard not to be a packer fan.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

They kicked the Bears ass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I watched the game at Major Goolsby’s with a couple of my friends. Packers played really well in the first and second quarter with a touchdown in each. Then their game was down and they were struggling just like Chicago Bears (but, the bears still suck!). There was nothing in third quarter. Fourth quarter was really intense. The crowd went crazy when Raji touchdown on an interception. The score was 21-7 Packers leading. Bears fought back with a touchdown in next 80 seconds or so taking the score to 21-14.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Winter in Milwaukee</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/first-winter-in-milwaukee/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2011 06:30:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/first-winter-in-milwaukee/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just when I started to laugh at people who were scaring me about the winter, mother nature made sure I shut up. It was a total pain to walk 6 blocks back home from office today! The main problem is the wind. If it isn&amp;rsquo;t for the wind chill factor, the winter is not much of a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s getting freaking cold here in Milwaukee; it&amp;rsquo;s expected to hit -8°F(-22°C) tomorrow and with the wind and other factors, it&amp;rsquo;s expected to feel like -27°F(-32°C). To say the least, that sucks!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cricket: India versus USA</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/cricket-india-versus-usa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2010 04:28:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/cricket-india-versus-usa/</guid><description>&lt;p>It was about a month after the softball match between &lt;em>India and USA&lt;/em>, the Americans wanted to try a match of Cricket. Rightly so, Cricket to Americans is like softball to Indians. We did have a match and due to less attendance on USA team, it was played after shuffling the teams.&lt;/p>

Quarter final match - 2010 FIFA World Cup&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was sleepy, but somehow this match seemed too good to miss. I had to wash my face with cold water to stay awake. I must tell you, it was WORTH it. Much much more than WORTH it. An exciting match. Last few moments I had my heart in my mouth. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t supporting any of the teams, but still I feel heartbroken; Ghana should have won. Unfair.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Highest Runs In An ODI Match – Sachin Tendulkar</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/highest-runs-in-an-odi-match-sachin-tendulkar/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2010 04:30:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/highest-runs-in-an-odi-match-sachin-tendulkar/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have come across a lot of comments, communications, posts, and people (even my Dad and Bro) where they mention how they hated a Pakistani cricketer(Saeed Anwar) holding the record for highest ODI runs in a match. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand! A cricketer is a cricketer, a game is a game, a record is a record, what does it have to do with the citizenship?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What would you(esp. Indians) have called Sachin, if he was a Pakistani? A devil? &lt;strong>&lt;em>=P&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
