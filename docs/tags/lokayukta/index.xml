I used to wonder what made them do what they did especially when the person who did it was indeed very poor. Why didn&amp;rsquo;t s/he keep it her/himself, used it to feed his family, made a life out of it. One moment I would think, returning it made no sense at all and the next moment I would just imagine the plight of the people who lost it. What if someone lost all their hard earned money, a life time of savings, what if if was from a poor father carrying it to arrange for his daughter&amp;rsquo;s wedding? It made perfect sense to return it. The happiness that it&amp;rsquo;d bring when one loses something precious and find it later; the good feel that it&amp;rsquo;d instill in one&amp;rsquo;s heart; the give-back/do-the-same-thing attitude that it&amp;rsquo;d bring seemed much more valuable than the actual item&amp;rsquo;s worth.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
