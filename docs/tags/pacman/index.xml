&lt;p>I have Packer and Vagrant setup to create arch Linux virtual machines. I create new VMs for various tasks and throw them out once done. I do have one or two VMs that I just keep long term. One of those VMs didn&amp;rsquo;t boot up after an update. &lt;code>pacman -Syuu&lt;/code> updated many packages and the kernel was upgraded to 6.11.8. I remember catching some warning in the corner of my eye as I was closing the terminal. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much about it and went about my business until I tried to boot it up.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
