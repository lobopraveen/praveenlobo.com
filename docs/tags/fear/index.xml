I did what I wanted to and have no regrets. I have been able to shut them up with just asking if they have the balls to do it before talking smack!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can take a good tease but the attitude of getting things done quickly and avoiding lines even if it means paying bribe irks me to the core. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind having a healthy discussion, but with some so determined to pay bribe to get things done quickly and wholeheartedly oppose anyone who fights corruption, any discussion is a waste of time and energy. Many of my American friends are optimistic and talk positively (esp. knowing the Gandhi episode), but many of my own countrymen are very very skeptical and pessimistic. If well educated people don&amp;rsquo;t support a cause and act overly smart, what do you think will change? Everything has to start some way and someday, why not make this a starting point for a good future?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Last Day at the Dance Class</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/last-day-at-the-dance-class/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2010 06:25:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/last-day-at-the-dance-class/</guid><description>&lt;p>A little sadness has taken over me. Today was my last day at Dance Verve. Remember &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/blog/a-week-that-was/">this last paragraph&lt;/a>? A week after that I joined Dance Verve at BTM Check Post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember the very first day - I entered the class when Taj Khan (we call him sir) was not yet in. I talked to two guys (now I know them - Pavan and Manas) and sir arrived in about 15 minutes. He asked to join right then as I introduced myself. Somehow I was still very nervous and said I&amp;rsquo;d join from the next day. I didn&amp;rsquo;t forget to mention that I had never danced before (of course Salsa apart) and I tried may times and failed miserably. I used to get very conscious. He just smiled and said, it will take sometime before I can dance and I should be regular.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
