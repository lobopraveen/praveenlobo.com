      <description>Green Bay Packers didn&#39;t disappoint in the playoff; they did just what I hoped for in my previous post, First Winter in Milwaukee. They kicked the Bears ass.
I watched the game at Major Goolsby’s with a couple of my friends. Packers played really well in the first and second quarter with a touchdown in each. Then their game was down and they were struggling just like Chicago Bears (but, the bears still suck!</description>

      <description>Just when I started to laugh at people who were scaring me about the winter, mother nature made sure I shut up. It was a total pain to walk 6 blocks back home from office today! The main problem is the wind. If it isn&#39;t for the wind chill factor, the winter is not much of a problem.
It&#39;s getting freaking cold here in Milwaukee; it&#39;s expected to hit -8°F(-22°C) tomorrow and with the wind and other factors, it&#39;s expected to feel like -27°F(-32°C).</description>
