&lt;p>The game at Major Goolsby&amp;rsquo;s with a couple of my friends - Shailesh, Myself, Balaji, Bharath, Mada, Ramendra (behind the camera).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Bears Still Suck!!!</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/the-bears-still-suck/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2011 03:35:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/the-bears-still-suck/</guid><description>&lt;p>Green Bay Packers didn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint in the playoff; they did just what I hoped for in my previous post, &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/blog/first-winter-in-milwaukee/">First Winter in Milwaukee&lt;/a>. They kicked the Bears ass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I watched the game at Major Goolsby’s with a couple of my friends. Packers played really well in the first and second quarter with a touchdown in each. Then their game was down and they were struggling just like Chicago Bears (but, the bears still suck!). There was nothing in third quarter. Fourth quarter was really intense. The crowd went crazy when Raji touchdown on an interception. The score was 21-7 Packers leading. Bears fought back with a touchdown in next 80 seconds or so taking the score to 21-14.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Winter in Milwaukee</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/first-winter-in-milwaukee/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2011 06:30:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/first-winter-in-milwaukee/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just when I started to laugh at people who were scaring me about the winter, mother nature made sure I shut up. It was a total pain to walk 6 blocks back home from office today! The main problem is the wind. If it isn&amp;rsquo;t for the wind chill factor, the winter is not much of a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s getting freaking cold here in Milwaukee; it&amp;rsquo;s expected to hit -8°F(-22°C) tomorrow and with the wind and other factors, it&amp;rsquo;s expected to feel like -27°F(-32°C). To say the least, that sucks!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
