If you have no clue, this post isn&amp;rsquo;t for you and if you want to know what it is, it is an ugly looking additional &amp;ldquo;/blog/&amp;rdquo; in the permalinks (URLs) in your website that comes free with the multisite feature in WordPress. Why ugly? Because it comes uninvited, it&amp;rsquo;s there and most probably you don&amp;rsquo;t want it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do you remove the additional &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; in the URL of your posts? Simple, install some plugin which does it for you? That is what I thought; however, before doing so, I just took a careful look at the &lt;code>wp_options&lt;/code> table. BAM! There it was. After spending about 30 minutes with settings and checking the data in this table, I have figured out a way to solve the blog slug problem without the need for a plugin. No need to change a bit of code. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need to execute any queries. The query and the table values are shown below just to indicate what your action does to the database values. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple process; only step 2 and 3 need your action, you can skip the rest!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
