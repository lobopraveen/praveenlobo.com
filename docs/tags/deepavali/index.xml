      <description>My second Deepavali in Milwaukee. Celebrated by visiting temple, doing a small pooja at home and then at a friend‚Äôs place. Prepared gulab jamun, had lot of wonderful food at potluck in friend‚Äôs place. Concluded it with firecrackers.
My roommates kept American dollars next to Indian rupees on the alter. I wonder what they were praying for. üòù
