      <description>You know by now, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit concerned about this weather. While checking the weather forecast, I came up with this idea of comparing the weather between Bangalore and Milwaukee. Just for giggles.
The below graphs are drawn with the data available freely on the net(weather.com, wikipedia and wunderground.com). I believe they should be fairly accurate.

      <description>The weather has been truly devastating this summer (Milwaukee 2011). National Weather Service issued heat advisory; many sources reminding the deadly heat from 1995 and 1988 which took a lot of lives! The weather forecasts, news-sites, and other sources of information on the internet are terrifying.
Rewind to 2010 I landed exactly one year ago in Milwaukee. The weather was not bad. It compared to the weather I was used to in Bangalore.</description>
