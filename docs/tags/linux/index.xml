      <description>Very first impression(within a minute of installing):
 WTF, it hung!
 I had kept /home on a separate partition for the first time and wanted to check if it works fine for all users. I created an account and set the home folder as /home/irine and then hit save - switch user - log off - WTF!
Bug #574909
Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) is impressive; thanks to all those who made it possible :o)</description>

      <description>A post about switching the Operating System(OS)? Yeah, why not? After all It&amp;rsquo;s the OS that made one man the richest in the world. It&amp;rsquo;s the OS that has made so many people across the globe dedicate their own resources and time to better it. It&amp;rsquo;s the OS that makes people argue - be it MS vs Linux or different distributions of Linux itself!
I&amp;rsquo;m not a Linux freak or a guru but an average user helping the open source in a way that most of the people do - by using it!</description>
