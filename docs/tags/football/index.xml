      <description>Elle Meissner - The Lions haven’t won a championship since her grandfather was 5 and haven’t won a playoff game since her father was 10, in her lifetime, the Detroit Lions haven’t lost a game. more
 This news reminded me that I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen a single game that Green Bay Packers lost! The first time I heard of American Football was at the end of 2006 in a session helping people understand the basics of the game.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned earlier, I was able to get the tickets for the opening game of the season on September 8th, 2011. The world champions take on the New Orleans Saints. We also managed to make some time to visit the hall of fame. One thing I learned during this visit was the super bowl ring is not given just to the players but also to coaches, trainers, executives, personnel, and general staff!</description>

      <description>Green Bay Packers didn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint in the playoff; they did just what I hoped for in my previous post, First Winter in Milwaukee. They kicked the Bears ass.
I watched the game at Major Goolsby’s with a couple of my friends. Packers played really well in the first and second quarter with a touchdown in each. Then their game was down and they were struggling just like Chicago Bears (but, the bears still suck!</description>

      <description>Just when I started to laugh at people who were scaring me about the winter, mother nature made sure I shut up. It was a total pain to walk 6 blocks back home from office today! The main problem is the wind. If it isn&amp;rsquo;t for the wind chill factor, the winter is not much of a problem.
It&amp;rsquo;s getting freaking cold here in Milwaukee; it&amp;rsquo;s expected to hit -8°F(-22°C) tomorrow and with the wind and other factors, it&amp;rsquo;s expected to feel like -27°F(-32°C).</description>

      <description>Uruguay vs. Ghana Quarter final match - 2010 FIFA World Cup
I was sleepy, but somehow this match seemed too good to miss. I had to wash my face with cold water to stay awake. I must tell you, it was WORTH it. Much much more than WORTH it. An exciting match. Last few moments I had my heart in my mouth. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t supporting any of the teams, but still I feel heartbroken; Ghana should have won.</description>
