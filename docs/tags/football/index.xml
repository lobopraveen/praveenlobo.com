&lt;p>Elle Meissner - The Lions haven’t won a championship since her grandfather was 5 and haven’t won a playoff game since her father was 10, in her lifetime, the Detroit Lions haven’t lost a game.

&lt;p>This news reminded me that I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen a single game that Green Bay Packers lost! The first time I heard of American Football was at the end of 2006 in a session helping people understand the basics of the game. It was conducted by one of my senior colleague in Mangalore office. I never really got interested until I moved to Milwaukee in 2010. I kept on hearing about football for months before I really followed anything.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My First Game At The Lambeau Field</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/my-first-game-at-the-lambeau-field-packers-vs-saints/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2011 01:37:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/my-first-game-at-the-lambeau-field-packers-vs-saints/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/blog/a-visit-to-the-frozen-tundra-lambeau-field/">As I mentioned earlier&lt;/a>, I was able to get the tickets for the opening game of the season on September 8th, 2011. The world champions take on the New Orleans Saints. We also managed to make some time to visit the hall of fame. One thing I learned during this visit was the super bowl ring is not given just to the players but also to coaches, trainers, executives, personnel, and general staff! The winning team can present the rings to whomever they choose.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Green Bay Packer on my Homepage</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/green-bay-packer-on-my-homepage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2011 07:59:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/green-bay-packer-on-my-homepage/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello world,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I dedicated my &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/index_archive/index_002.html">homepage&lt;/a> for Green Bay Packers on 6th February, 2011 and what they got me the same day?! THE SUPER BOWL!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s hard not to be a packer fan.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

They kicked the Bears ass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I watched the game at Major Goolsby’s with a couple of my friends. Packers played really well in the first and second quarter with a touchdown in each. Then their game was down and they were struggling just like Chicago Bears (but, the bears still suck!). There was nothing in third quarter. Fourth quarter was really intense. The crowd went crazy when Raji touchdown on an interception. The score was 21-7 Packers leading. Bears fought back with a touchdown in next 80 seconds or so taking the score to 21-14.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Winter in Milwaukee</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/first-winter-in-milwaukee/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2011 06:30:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/first-winter-in-milwaukee/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just when I started to laugh at people who were scaring me about the winter, mother nature made sure I shut up. It was a total pain to walk 6 blocks back home from office today! The main problem is the wind. If it isn&amp;rsquo;t for the wind chill factor, the winter is not much of a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s getting freaking cold here in Milwaukee; it&amp;rsquo;s expected to hit -8°F(-22°C) tomorrow and with the wind and other factors, it&amp;rsquo;s expected to feel like -27°F(-32°C). To say the least, that sucks!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hands of God</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/hands-of-god/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2010 21:51:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/hands-of-god/</guid><description>&lt;p>Uruguay vs. Ghana
Quarter final match - 2010 FIFA World Cup&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was sleepy, but somehow this match seemed too good to miss. I had to wash my face with cold water to stay awake. I must tell you, it was WORTH it. Much much more than WORTH it. An exciting match. Last few moments I had my heart in my mouth. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t supporting any of the teams, but still I feel heartbroken; Ghana should have won. Unfair.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
