      <description>Ever since I posted my skydiving post/video and dedicated it to the people fighting against corruption, some of my friends have been teasing me about it. I did what I wanted to and have no regrets. I have been able to shut them up with just asking if they have the balls to do it before talking smack!
I can take a good tease but the attitude of getting things done quickly and avoiding lines even if it means paying bribe irks me to the core.</description>

      <description>Finally on August 20th, 2011, I skydived for the first time, not only unheeding my friends&amp;rsquo; suggestions to go for tandem first and then solo/Accelerated Free Fall (AFF) but also my own fear of jumping into the unknown. I didn&#39;t know how it will be to fall from 14,000 feet, descending at 120MPH (193KMPH). I wasn&#39;t sure if the instructors will be able to guide me ntil the pull; I wasn&#39;t sure if the parachute will open fine or not; I wasn&#39;t sure if I would land on Interstate-94 and get dragged down the road.</description>

      <description>If everything went according to the plan, I&#39;d have had my first ever free-fall by now. But the mother nature had some other plans. Six friends and I had planned for a skydiving weekend on my room-mate&#39;s birthday last Saturday. Two of them had come down from Chicago. The venue was none other than the closest Skydive Midwest. None of us had previous experience and were looking forward to having a great time.</description>
