      <description>The day of stamping - My interview was schedule at 8:30AM and I was expected to be there by 8AM. The previous day night I set alarm for 6, 6:10, 6:15AM. My usual pattern even after which I don&amp;rsquo;t wake up! I slept through all three alarms and woke up when Mom called me to wish me at 7AM. The cab guy also called at the same time. Cleverly, I had ironed clothes and arranged documents in Bangalore itself; I got ready in just about 15 minutes.</description>

      <description>My H1B visa was approved in December 2009 and finally, I got to get it stamped on 18th May 2010. I had arranged allÂ documents by last Thursday and booked air tickets to Chennai. I had never travelled by air before; it was going to be myÂ first time. ðŸ˜ƒ
Monday morning I got a call from the cab driver who was lost trying to find me! After around 6-7 call and giving himÂ directions, he finally made it.</description>
