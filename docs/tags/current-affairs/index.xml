I doubt if many of the US citizens even understand how this works! So, I spent a couple of hours on this topic and decided to write about it. If you find any inaccuracies, I will be glad to fix it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>US presidential elections are important not just for the Americans but also for the rest of the world. We live in a world where a political change in one part of the world can have a big impact on some other parts of the world. When it comes to US, a dominant force in the world, any political change impacts nearly every part of the globe, and it is important that we, the rest of the world, know how the elections work!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I Paid A Bribe Once</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/i-paid-a-bribe-once/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2011 05:44:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/i-paid-a-bribe-once/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I was growing up, I used to read the articles in the newspaper about people returning the money/jewelry that somebody else had lost, the auto driver returning thousands of rupees the passengers had left behind. I used to wonder what made them do what they did especially when the person who did it was indeed very poor. Why didn&amp;rsquo;t s/he keep it her/himself, used it to feed his family, made a life out of it. One moment I would think, returning it made no sense at all and the next moment I would just imagine the plight of the people who lost it. What if someone lost all their hard earned money, a life time of savings, what if if was from a poor father carrying it to arrange for his daughter&amp;rsquo;s wedding? It made perfect sense to return it. The happiness that it&amp;rsquo;d bring when one loses something precious and find it later; the good feel that it&amp;rsquo;d instill in one&amp;rsquo;s heart; the give-back/do-the-same-thing attitude that it&amp;rsquo;d bring seemed much more valuable than the actual item&amp;rsquo;s worth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Strike Out Corruption In India</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/strike-out-corruption-in-india-support-jan-lokpal-bill/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2011 07:18:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/strike-out-corruption-in-india-support-jan-lokpal-bill/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/index_archive/index_004.html">CORRUPTION IN INDIA&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Will Jan Lokpal bill solve the issue? I don&amp;rsquo;t know for sure, but it will definitely set us on the right path by giving more power to those who matter. It&amp;rsquo;s heartening to see India united to fight against the corruption. If an old man [Anna Hazare] can do so much, why can&amp;rsquo;t the youth do more? If you can, &lt;strong>PLEASE SHOW YOUR SUPPORT&lt;/strong> in any way possible. Spread the word.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BBMP Elections and Women Reservation</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/bbmp-elections-and-women-reservation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Mar 2010 19:34:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/bbmp-elections-and-women-reservation/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruhat_Bengaluru_Mahanagara_Palike">BBMP&lt;/a> elections are scheduled for tomorrow. My ward is one of those wards reserved for women. That is nothing to be happy about! Reservation is a very noble plan with a pathetic implementation. I was trying to get as much information about the candidates as possible so that I can vote for the most eligible. There are seven women candidates contesting in the election from my ward. As far as I could see, all of them are wives or relatives of politically powerful men and I find most of them incapable!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
