 Just because you do not take an interest in politics doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean politics won&amp;rsquo;t take an interest in you. Pericles  :: Petrol has gone up image
reporduced wihtout names
[9:14 AM, 5/24/2018] Praveen Lobo: Little does he know that ancient India had aircrafts that didn&amp;rsquo;t even need petrol. Our PM is digging to find more evidence. ðŸ˜œ [9:15 AM, 5/24/2018] Praveen Lobo: Also, no links. No timestamp. Looks like subtle propoganda for 2019.</description>

      <description>The 2016 US presidential election campaigns are underway, and they areÂ very entertaining!Â I do not know to the full extent how this entire presidential election works. I doubt if many of the US citizens even understand how this works! So, I spent a couple of hours on this topic and decided to write about it. If you find any inaccuracies, I will be glad to fix it!
US presidential elections are important not just for the Americans but also for the rest of the world.</description>

      <description>When I was growing up, I used to read the articles in the newspaper about people returning the money/jewelry that somebody else had lost, the auto driver returning thousands of rupees the passengers had left behind. I used to wonder what made them do what they did especially when the person who did it was indeed very poor. Why didn&amp;rsquo;t s/he keep it her/himself, used it to feed his family, made a life out of it.</description>

      <description>CORRUPTION IN INDIA
Will Jan Lokpal bill solve the issue? I don&amp;rsquo;t know for sure, but it will definitely set us on the right path by giving more power to those who matter. It&amp;rsquo;s heartening to see India united to fight against the corruption. If an old man [Anna Hazare] can do so much, why can&amp;rsquo;t the youth do more? If you can, PLEASE SHOW YOUR SUPPORT in any way possible.</description>

      <title>BBMP Elections and Women Reservation</title>

      <description>BBMP elections are scheduled for tomorrow. My ward is one of those wards reserved for women. That is nothing to be happy about! Reservation is a very noble plan with a pathetic implementation. I was trying to get as much information about the candidates as possible so that I can vote for the most eligible. There are seven women candidates contesting in the election from my ward. As far as I could see, all of them are wives or relatives of politically powerful men and I find most of them incapable!</description>
