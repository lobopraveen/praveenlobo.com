      <description>Pictured Rocks is a U.S. National Lakeshore on the shore of Lake Superior in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It is a beautiful place up north, just google and you wonâ€™t disagree. Kayaking in the sea? Wouldnâ€™t it be amazing? We set to find out.
  Rental Car
   Plan: On the September long weekend (Labor day holiday) start from Milwaukee on Saturday, explore Mackinac Island, Pictured Rocks sea kayaking on Sunday, and sightseeing and returning on Monday.</description>

      <description>Niagara, New York, United States   Terrapin Point, Goat Island
   The next day as planned we drove to Niagara falls. There were a lot of people; I could see a lot of Indians as well. You probably won&#39;t believe me but I met my a friend from my college (India) with his friends on Goat Island, I had no clue he was also visiting. Then I met another friend of mine from Bangalore on the Observation Tower!</description>

      <description>Cedar Point, Sandusky, Ohio, United States. During the long weekend of September 2010, I visited Cedar Point and Niagara falls along with three other friends. It was an awesome trip. We took a flight from Milwaukee to Cleveland Ohio and rented a car from airport for the entire trip. The plan was to go to Cedar Point one day, visit Niagara next day, and head back the day after.
First we drove to Cedar Point (Sandusky Ohio) from Marriott (Cleveland Airport Marriott).</description>

      <description>On a Friday&#39;s evening, eight of us set out to Devil&#39;s Lake State Park, Wisconsin in two cars. We reached when it was dark and setup three tents in two camps. The rain god was happy and decided not to play spoilsport; it poured only when we were in the tent.

      <title>Skiing on Cascade mountains, Wisconsin</title>

      <description>Another ski trip. This time just for a day. I loved skiing last time so much that when I heard that another group was heading to Cascade Mountains, I simply couldn&#39;t resist.
We had two guys who had never skied before so we helped them on the bunny hills and moved on to others slopes. Though I&#39;m a newbie I could tell that the snow at the Ski Brule was better.</description>

      <description>Lobo(Ski Brule)
    Buckhorn Chalet
   Around twenty of us drove up to Ski Brule, Iron River Michigan, on Thursday and stayed at Buckhorn Chalet right in front of the slopes. The slopes looked so beautiful and scary at the same time. I was excited to ski for the first time the very next day.

   When we reached there, there was a free lessons for first timers (should register beforehand).</description>

      <description>Skiing is fun. As a beginner, it is something you will hate during but love afterward. If you have skied already, you&#39;ll easily dismiss me, but if you have not then you&#39;ll know what I&#39;m talking about. Don&#39;t get me wrong here, if you have never been skiing before and if you have a chance, just pack up and go. It is fun. It is as much fun to ski as it is pain as a beginner.</description>

      <description>I can write a detailed travelogue, but I don&#39;t want to bore you to death! I don&#39;t think I&#39;m good at writing! Here is the short version! ðŸ˜ƒ
A weeks notice was all I got about my first ever business trip. To work at client&#39;s location, to deal with client interaction, to deal with the cultural differences, and the list goes on. Though I was prepared for all of it, I was caught off guard with other stuff.</description>

      <description>Update (2018): TMI galore!
Mangalore. Stirs up a lot of feeling. The first city, other than Bangalore, where I spent more than a year, the city where I lived independently, the city where I gained financial independence, the city where I started watching movies (for real!), the city which has given me a few best friends, the city where I fell in love&amp;hellip; I have so many fond memories of this city that I could go on and on and on.</description>
