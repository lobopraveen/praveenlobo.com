      <description>Niagara, New York, United States The next day as planned we drove to Niagara falls. There were a lot of people; I could see a lot of Indians as well. You probably won&#39;t believe me but I met my a friend from my college (India) with his friends on Goat Island, I had no clue he was also visiting. Then I met another friend of mine from Bangalore on the Observation Tower!</description>

      <description>Cedar Point, Sandusky, Ohio, United States. During the long weekend of September 2010, I visited Cedar Point and Niagara falls along with three other friends. It was an awesome trip. We took a flight from Milwaukee to Cleveland Ohio and rented a car from airport for the entire trip. The plan was to go to Cedar Point one day, visit Niagara next day, and head back the day after.
First we drove to Cedar Point (Sandusky Ohio) from Marriott (Cleveland Airport Marriott).</description>
