      <description>Continued from here&amp;hellip;
Advantages/Disadvantages: Advantages of multiple blogs include monetization, ease of finding advertisers, reaching right audience, and building a resource of articles all in the same niche. Disadvantages? Unless you are an expert you will run out of good articles, might have to hire writers. Multiple blogs needs more time in terms of maintenance, updates etc. It needs more resources which cost money.
You will have enough time on your hand with a single blog and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about all blogs that miss your constant love.</description>
