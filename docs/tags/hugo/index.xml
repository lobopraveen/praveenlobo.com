      <description>Original post date: 2018-05-01. Edited to include changes made in 2020. I don&#39;t build locally anymore so the script is basically unused; however, I did update it to make it slightly better. The Travis script has been updated to make it generic. Only the environment variables need to be changed if anyone else decides to use it.
 After migrating the blog to Hugo and making some custom changes, it was time to develop the CI-CD pipeline.</description>

      <description>While working on migrating this site from WordPress to Hugo, I did tweak somethings to make it work for my liking. I usually keep things simple so that future changes are as painless as possible, however, I decided to go ahead with these changes as it improved maintainability and reverting these changes are very straight forward.
Hugo&#39;s default publish directory Hugo generates the static site content in public directory by default.</description>

      <description>I have been telling myself that I will get back into blogging again and again in vain. I have a bunch of drafts that I have not posted; I keep thinking about posting them and posting my views about current affairs and daily life. For some reason I just can&#39;t commit to it. I feel like I have hit this big writer&#39;s block and I somehow don&#39;t want to get out if it.</description>
