      <description>Original post date: 2018-05-01. Edited to include changes made in 2020. I don&#39;t build locally anymore so the script is basically unused; however, I did update it to make it slightly better. The Travis script has been updated to make it generic. Only the environment variables need to be changed if anyone else decides to use it.
 After migrating the blog to Hugo and making some custom changes, it was time to develop the CI-CD pipeline.</description>
