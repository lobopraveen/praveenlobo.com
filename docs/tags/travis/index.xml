      <description>After migrating the blog to Hugo and making some custom changes, it was time to develop the CI-CD pipeline. The key objectives for my CI-CD pipeline were
 to be able to build the site locally and to be able to build the site remotely on the integration server  Build Locally More often than not, I use my computer to post stuff on this site. As I already have the site repo and Hugo on my machine, I run the hugo server --buildDrafts while editing the repo with a browser window open on my secondary monitor to monitor the edits.</description>
