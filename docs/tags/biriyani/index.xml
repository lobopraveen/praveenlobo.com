There is something with me and updating this blog. There are a couple of more drafts. I plan to post all of them in next two weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I&amp;rsquo;m not following the recipes which I read somewhere, I will keep it very simple. First I check what are the items I can use, then etch a plan, pick the items, and cook. That is exactly what I did today. The recipes are very simple and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to type it - I&amp;rsquo;m a little bored to do that now. May be some other day.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
