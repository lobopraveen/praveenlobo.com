      <description>The latest version of this should be available on GitHub repo. Please report any issues there.
The following snippets show how to change the file name extensions on multiple files on UNIX machines. Other commands like rename and mmv might offer alternatives when they are available on the systems. The scripts below use shell&amp;rsquo;s parameter expansion to operate on multiple files.
 % in below scripts match shortest from the end of the string.</description>

CSV files with values that contain commas in them is a pain if the system was built to handle the basic CSV format. This is especially true if the process that has been running for ages fails one day in production and it turns out that the file to process has a value that contains a comma in it.</description>

      <title>O_ops: Better Logging To Solve Problems</title>

      <description>Logging helps in pinpointing the code block that threw an error. Only if they are used correctly. During once such failure, a guy noticed that a script lacked logging and ever promptly promoted the updated script with better logging. A part of the script is shown below.
Script before: 1&amp;gt;&amp;gt;${LOG} 2&amp;gt;&amp;gt;${ERRLOG} ${BINPATH}/${PROGRAMNAME} if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then print &amp;#34;ERROR: Something failed&amp;#34; exit 101 fi
Script after:
1&amp;gt;&amp;gt;${LOG} 2&amp;gt;&amp;gt;${ERRLOG} ${BINPATH}/${PROGRAMNAME} echo &amp;#34;Program completed successfully.</description>

      <description>Say Autosys job called jobName executes with xyz id. The profile used is profile; owner of profile is abc and neither group nor others have execute permission on this profile. jobName executes jobScript which is owned by xyz(both jobName and jobScript are owned by xyz). abc and xyz are two users. There is a group abc as well.
$id abc uid=1234(abc) gid=10(abc) $id xyz uid=1234(xyz) gid=10(users) $ll profile -r-xr+++-- 1 abc abc 1000 [.</description>

      <title>Automate Torrent Download Using Transmission</title>

      <description>A while ago I wrote about swget - A Simple wget Wrapper The methods described don&amp;rsquo;t work for torrents. Today I had to download a video which was not available through direct download, but I found a few torrents for the same. After fiddling around with the scheduler available in Transmission I found it to be absolutely useless; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work!
After a little search on the net, I found a workaround for this too!</description>

      <description>THE PROBLEM I have BSNL 500C+ broadband connection which gives me 2.5GB of data transfer per month. This limit is sufficient only for usual surfing. 500C+ plan also gives me night unlimited option i.e. the data transferred between 2AM to 8AM is not counted towards the 2.5GB quota per month. I can download around 4GB in this time frame. I use this timeÂ to download contents, but the real problem is starting the download at 2AM.</description>
