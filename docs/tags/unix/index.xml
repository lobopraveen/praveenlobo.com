      <description>Say Autosys job called jobName executes with xyz id. The profile used is profile; owner of profile is abc and neither group nor others have execute permission on this profile. jobName executes jobScript which is owned by xyz(both jobName and jobScript are owned by xyz). abc and xyz are two users. There is a group abc as well.
$id abc uid=1234(abc) gid=10(abc) $id xyz uid=1234(xyz) gid=10(users) $ll profile -r-xr+++-- 1 abc abc 1000 [.</description>

      <description>A while ago I wrote about swget - A Simple wget Wrapper The methods described don&amp;rsquo;t work for torrents. Today I had to download a video which was not available through direct download, but I found a few torrents for the same. After fiddling around with the scheduler available in Transmission I found it to be absolutely useless; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work!
After a little search on the net, I found a workaround for this too!</description>

      <description>THE PROBLEM I have BSNL 500C+ broadband connection which gives me 2.5GB of data transfer per month. This limit is sufficient only for usual surfing. 500C+ plan also gives me night unlimited option i.e. the data transferred between 2AM to 8AM is not counted towards the 2.5GB quota per month. I can download around 4GB in this time frame. I use this timeÂ to download contents, but the real problem is starting the download at 2AM.</description>
