Packers won 19 consecutive games before I ever saw them lose. It was rather disappointing to see them lose against Chiefs; it was heartbreaking to see them lose in the very first game of the playoffs. That doesn’t deter me from calling myself a Packer fan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, wait a minute, I’m not just a fan; I’m a mutual owner of Green Bay Packers! I own a part of NFL’s most mesmerizing team - the Green Bay Packers. I was just wondering if there are other Indians who own Green Bay Packers’ stock? Surely, there must be more!?!?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Perfect Season - Green Bay Packers</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/a-perfect-season-green-bay-packers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2011 18:11:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/a-perfect-season-green-bay-packers/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Elle Meissner - The Lions haven’t won a championship since her grandfather was 5 and haven’t won a playoff game since her father was 10, in her lifetime, the Detroit Lions haven’t lost a game.

&lt;p>This news reminded me that I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen a single game that Green Bay Packers lost! The first time I heard of American Football was at the end of 2006 in a session helping people understand the basics of the game. It was conducted by one of my senior colleague in Mangalore office. I never really got interested until I moved to Milwaukee in 2010. I kept on hearing about football for months before I really followed anything.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My First Game At The Lambeau Field</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/my-first-game-at-the-lambeau-field-packers-vs-saints/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2011 01:37:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/my-first-game-at-the-lambeau-field-packers-vs-saints/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/blog/a-visit-to-the-frozen-tundra-lambeau-field/">As I mentioned earlier&lt;/a>, I was able to get the tickets for the opening game of the season on September 8th, 2011. The world champions take on the New Orleans Saints. We also managed to make some time to visit the hall of fame. One thing I learned during this visit was the super bowl ring is not given just to the players but also to coaches, trainers, executives, personnel, and general staff! The winning team can present the rings to whomever they choose.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Visit To The Frozen Tundra</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/a-visit-to-the-frozen-tundra-lambeau-field/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2011 01:45:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/a-visit-to-the-frozen-tundra-lambeau-field/</guid><description>&lt;div class='align-center'>

&lt;p>I have driven around the stadium once while returning from the Door County last fall. This time while returning from a &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/blog/a-trip-to-pictured-rocks-michigan">trip to Pictured Rocks&lt;/a>, I visited the Lambeau Field a.k.a The Frozen Tundra and took a tour of the stadium. It was just so unbelievable to be there and to learn some history about the Packers. I even got a customized replica jersey and a Packer&amp;rsquo;s Rubik cube among other things.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Indians Are The World Champions</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/indians-are-the-world-champions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2011 06:41:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/indians-are-the-world-champions/</guid><description>&lt;p>You know by now.

&lt;p>Remember &amp;ldquo;More than a billion hearts and one shared dream&amp;rdquo;? That&amp;rsquo;s what I &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/blog/2011-world-cup-men-in-blue-will-rock-the-world/">wrote&lt;/a> when the world cup started. That dream has come true! Now more than 50% of Indian population can proudly say they saw their captain lift the world cup at least once in their life. Glory!&lt;/p>

They kicked the Bears ass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I watched the game at Major Goolsby’s with a couple of my friends. Packers played really well in the first and second quarter with a touchdown in each. Then their game was down and they were struggling just like Chicago Bears (but, the bears still suck!). There was nothing in third quarter. Fourth quarter was really intense. The crowd went crazy when Raji touchdown on an interception. The score was 21-7 Packers leading. Bears fought back with a touchdown in next 80 seconds or so taking the score to 21-14.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Winter in Milwaukee</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/first-winter-in-milwaukee/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2011 06:30:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/first-winter-in-milwaukee/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just when I started to laugh at people who were scaring me about the winter, mother nature made sure I shut up. It was a total pain to walk 6 blocks back home from office today! The main problem is the wind. If it isn&amp;rsquo;t for the wind chill factor, the winter is not much of a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s getting freaking cold here in Milwaukee; it&amp;rsquo;s expected to hit -8°F(-22°C) tomorrow and with the wind and other factors, it&amp;rsquo;s expected to feel like -27°F(-32°C). To say the least, that sucks!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
