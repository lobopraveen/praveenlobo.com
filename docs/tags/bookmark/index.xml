&lt;p>How do you manage your bookmarks?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a regular question usually from new team members for the past ten years or so. My answer has been the same, &amp;ldquo;I use a tool I wrote.&amp;rdquo; followed by, &amp;ldquo;I will send you a link. You can use it from there or just make a copy of your own.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember myself asking that question to others when I first started the job in mid 2000s. Most of my seniors liked to store the links in excel or a word document as we were not allowed to use any browser other than the Internet Explorer (IE) and the bookmarks in IE weren&amp;rsquo;t searchable. No tools were allowed either. This was, and in some cases still is, a common thing at workplaces in enterprises.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
