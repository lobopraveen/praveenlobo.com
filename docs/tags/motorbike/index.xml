Motorbikes were convenient, affordable, and fast. I had bought myself a TVS Suzuki Fiero DS (India&amp;rsquo;s first 150cc bike I think) and I was using it for everyday commute. I had sold my first bicycle and didn&amp;rsquo;t have one to ride. As it happens as one grows up, I had given up on bicycles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After moving to US, I live very close walk to work and don&amp;rsquo;t need any vehicles for travel. Then there is always new rental cars at cheap rates if need be. Milwaukee downtown is not that big and I can easily walk to almost all places. However, commuting around downtown (like going to lake side, tennis courts, or coffee shop) really made me think about the bicycles again.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
