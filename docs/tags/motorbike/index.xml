      <description>I used to love bicycles until I started working and moved on to ride motorbikes. Motorbikes were convenient, affordable, and fast. I had bought myself a TVS Suzuki Fiero DS (India&amp;rsquo;s first 150cc bike I think) and I was using it for everyday commute. I had sold my first bicycle and didn&amp;rsquo;t have one to ride. As it happens as one grows up, I had given up on bicycles.
After moving to US, I live very close walk to work and don&amp;rsquo;t need any vehicles for travel.</description>
