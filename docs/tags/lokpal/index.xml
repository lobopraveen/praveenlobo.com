      <description>Finally on August 20th, 2011, I skydived for the first time, not only unheeding my friends&amp;rsquo; suggestions to go for tandem first and then solo/Accelerated Free Fall (AFF) but also my own fear of jumping into the unknown. I didn&#39;t know how it will be to fall from 14,000 feet, descending at 120MPH (193KMPH). I wasn&#39;t sure if the instructors will be able to guide me ntil the pull; I wasn&#39;t sure if the parachute will open fine or not; I wasn&#39;t sure if I would land on Interstate-94 and get dragged down the road.</description>

      <description>When I was growing up, I used to read the articles in the newspaper about people returning the money/jewelry that somebody else had lost, the auto driver returning thousands of rupees the passengers had left behind. I used to wonder what made them do what they did especially when the person who did it was indeed very poor. Why didn&#39;t s/he keep it her/himself, used it to feed his family, made a life out of it.</description>

      <description>CORRUPTION IN INDIA
Will Jan Lokpal bill solve the issue? I don&#39;t know for sure, but it will definitely set us on the right path by giving more power to those who matter. It&#39;s heartening to see India united to fight against the corruption. If an old man [Anna Hazare] can do so much, why can&#39;t the youth do more? If you can, PLEASE SHOW YOUR SUPPORT in any way possible.</description>
