Yeah, why not? After all It&amp;rsquo;s the OS that made one man the richest in the world. It&amp;rsquo;s the OS that has made so many people across the globe dedicate their own resources and time to better it. It&amp;rsquo;s the OS that makes people argue - be it MS vs Linux or different distributions of Linux itself!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not a Linux freak or a guru but an average user helping the open source in a way that most of the people do - by using it! I have been using a personal computer since 2004 and have been using Fedora Core for more than 95% of my personal use. I have tried a lot of different flavours of Linux but no clue why I stuck to Fedora all this time.Â  No, I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that it is bad; I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been using it for such a long time if it was, right? Fedora rocks but I just got bored of it!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
