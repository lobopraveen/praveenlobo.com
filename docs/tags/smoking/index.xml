For the initial four or five years it was more or less like two or three cigarettes a year, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a smoker then by any standard. :o) However, I really started smoking nearly three years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been on and off at it. I quit smoking for a couple of months a couple of times in these three years. The longest period was around six months. I was very convinced that I&amp;rsquo;d never smoke again until one day, in late 2009, when a friend of mine asked me to accompany him to the smoking area (Anna shop next to &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Infosys&amp;#43;Limited/@12.9047813,74.8363542,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xdfdd5d7661b0cb5!8m2!3d12.9047813!4d74.8363542?sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9rKnUxPzZAhVG7VMKHUjFB78Q_BIItQEwDg">Infosys Mangalore DC&lt;/a>). Unfortunately, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t refuse when he offered me a cigarette. After that there was no looking back, I had on an average one a day!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
