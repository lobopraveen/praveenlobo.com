      <description>I started smoking, I guess, eight or nine years ago. For the initial four or five years it was more or less like two or three cigarettes a year, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a smoker then by any standard. :o) However, I really started smoking nearly three years ago.
I have been on and off at it. I quit smoking for a couple of months a couple of times in these three years.</description>
