      <description>After migrating the blog to Hugo and making some custom changes, it was time to develop the CI-CD pipeline. The key objectives for my CI-CD pipeline were
 to be able to build the site locally and to be able to build the site remotely on an integration server  Build Locally More often than not, I use my computer to post stuff on this site. As I already have the site repo and Hugo on my machine, I run the hugo server --buildDrafts while editing the repo with a browser window open on my secondary monitor to monitor the edits.</description>

      <description>Part I and II of this post series can be found here and here respectively.
 5. Build the script: Assume that the HTML skeleton given in previous post is indeed the code and when the bid ends the timer gets a class called BIDEND. Finally, say the code used by the site to place a bid is PennyAuction.placeBid(itemCode);. With this information build a script.
// Get the codes from the user // Note : If it&amp;#39;s integer then parseInt method can be used around the prompt.</description>

 3. Requirements for the script:   The script shall have a lower limit to start bidding i.e. the script should not start bidding if the actual price in the bid hasn&#39;t crossed a set limit.
  The script shall have an upper limit to bidding i.e. it shall stop bidding if the bid price crosses certain limit.</description>

      <description>I wrote a prologue to penny auction sites beginning of this year, but never posted the bot script I promised I would! I didn&#39;t because I didn&#39;t want others to lose money, but shouldn&#39;t one use his own judgment before using any advice found on the Internet? Before anything else I would like to warn you - use the information found here at your own risk. I shall not be held liable for any damage - monetary or otherwise.</description>
