      <description>It has been a long time since I blogged regularly. We have a couple of weeks of summer left in 2012 and I don’t want to waste that spending more time on blogging. Lately, I have been feeling like blogging is a winter activity (not saying that I blog regularly in winter). There are a number of topics blog about but no time. I keep adding topics to the todo list and keep deleting when I revisit because it’s either too late or it is making the list too big.</description>

      <description>My day at work had just began, when I overheard a colleague of mine talking about rule number two. He is very senior to me and is dangerously intelligent! I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop myself from asking him what the rule number two was.
&amp;ldquo;Hey, what is rule number two?&amp;rdquo;, I asked.
&amp;ldquo;Well, do you know rule number one?&amp;rdquo;, he questioned.
I replied, &amp;ldquo;Nope&amp;rdquo;, thinking why didn&amp;rsquo;t I ask about rule number one first!</description>

      <description>A long weekend (four days) - many of my friends are on trips visiting places. I&amp;rsquo;m sitting here writing this post! I couldn&amp;rsquo;t go due to work. I had to work for a couple of hours exactly in the middle of the four days so I stayed back. It sure doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel good but not as bad as I imagined it to be. Almost 3/4th of the long weekend has gone by.</description>

      <title>A Week That Was</title>

      <description>Last week was the crappiest of all, but it ended in a good note. It oscillated between okay to bad, bad to worse, and back to okay and then to good. First two days were uneventful and I had no clue of what lie ahead.
Wednesday was the beginning. Firstly, a brand new system welcomed me to office on Wednesday morning; they had formatted my machine without any kind of confirmation.</description>
