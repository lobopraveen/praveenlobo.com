      <description>This morning on my way to office I saw an old couple walking across the street. The gentleman was walking at a-couple-inches-a-step pace and the lady, it seemed like, was moving only an inch with every single step. They were crossing a relatively free street and he was holding her hands and leading her. They crossed the street and then turned left to cross another one. A few cars stopped in front of them.</description>
