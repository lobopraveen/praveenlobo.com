&lt;p>I had a tough time searching for a blue map of India online and ended up creating them myself. With this post they are released online; you are free to use them as you may wish. However, a link to this blog is really appreciated (which I&amp;rsquo;m sure none of you are going to do! &amp;#x1f61d; )&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Indians Are The World Champions</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/indians-are-the-world-champions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2011 06:41:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/indians-are-the-world-champions/</guid><description>&lt;p>You know by now. Indians are the world champions! Yeah, say that again, WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember &amp;ldquo;More than a billion hearts and one shared dream&amp;rdquo;? That&amp;rsquo;s what I &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/blog/2011-world-cup-men-in-blue-will-rock-the-world/">wrote&lt;/a> when the world cup started. That dream has come true! Now more than 50% of Indian population can proudly say they saw their captain lift the world cup at least once in their life. Glory!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I dedicated the &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/index_archive/index_002.html">homepage&lt;/a> to Green Bay Packers and they won the super bowl; they are the Champions!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2011 World Cup</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/2011-world-cup-men-in-blue-will-rock-the-world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2011 06:27:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/2011-world-cup-men-in-blue-will-rock-the-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>My dear fellow Indians and everyone,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember 1983 Prudential world cup? Remember Captain Kapil Dev&amp;rsquo;s greatest catch that dethroned King Viv? No? Neither do I! It&amp;rsquo;s been 28 years since our captain lifted the cricket world cup. Not just me, nearly 50% of the current Indian population wasn&amp;rsquo;t even born back then!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More than a billion hearts and one shared dream, to see the men in blue lift the 2011 cricket world cup. Will it come true this time? Let us hope so.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
