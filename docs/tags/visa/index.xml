      <description>I had an H1B interview more than an year ago and written two blog posts about my travel to and from Bangalore and stay in Chennai (here and here). Surprisingly, even today &amp;ldquo;h1b&amp;rdquo; is one of the keywords getting highest number of visitors to my site (per Google Analytics). Most of them looking for interview questions. Recently I found a list I had prepared of probable questions the interviewer may ask.</description>

      <description>The day of stamping - My interview was schedule at 8:30AM and I was expected to be there by 8AM. The previous day night I set alarm for 6, 6:10, 6:15AM. My usual pattern even after which I don&#39;t wake up! I slept through all three alarms and woke up when Mom called me to wish me at 7AM. The cab guy also called at the same time. Cleverly, I had ironed clothes and arranged documents in Bangalore itself; I got ready in just about 15 minutes.</description>

      <description>My H1B visa was approved in December 2009 and finally, I got to get it stamped on 18th May 2010. I had arranged allÂ documents by last Thursday and booked air tickets to Chennai. I had never travelled by air before; it was going to be myÂ first time. ðŸ˜ƒ
Monday morning I got a call from the cab driver who was lost trying to find me! After around 6-7 call and giving himÂ directions, he finally made it.</description>
