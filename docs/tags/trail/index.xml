I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember when I jogged last. Gym has been on and off with a total I can count with my fingers of one hand. After all it&amp;rsquo;s for those who want to be fit; not for those who are already fit. &amp;#x1f609;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyhow, I started practicing for a 5K run scheduled for June 24th Sunday morning. I jogged 3 times in last 10 days. First two were short, may be 2 miles each. The last one went crazy and that is what this post all about!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
