      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m one of those lazy ones when it comes to gym or jogging. I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember when I jogged last. Gym has been on and off with a total I can count with my fingers of one hand. After all it&amp;rsquo;s for those who want to be fit; not for those who are already fit. ðŸ˜‰
Anyhow, I started practicing for a 5K run scheduled for June 24th Sunday morning.</description>
