      <description>Last weekend, I had one of my friend come over from Chicago. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t met him in nearly 6-7 years until a couple of days ago when I met him Chicago.

I think, it&amp;rsquo;s time to share and put them down here before they are completely erased from my already weak memories.</description>
