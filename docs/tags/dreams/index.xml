&lt;p>If you think this is a &amp;ldquo;own haircut how to&amp;rdquo;, let me tell you, you&amp;rsquo;ll be disappointed because it is not. However, you can read further to find out my tale with giving myself a haircut for the first time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was kid, I had this dream, albeit shot-lived, of becoming an hairstylist. But then I went to college trying to become an engineer! One fine day back from a bad haircut, I was thinking about it and decided to style my own hair for the first time. Just to give it a try! After some thinking, the easiest style was to go bald which is exactly what I used to do back in college; I used to shave my head twice a week and sport a beard. It continued for a couple months not only because I liked it but also due to the over-pouring compliments from friends and all those heads turned! So, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time I designed my own hairstyle.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
