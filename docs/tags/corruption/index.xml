I did what I wanted to and have no regrets. I have been able to shut them up with just asking if they have the balls to do it before talking smack!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can take a good tease but the attitude of getting things done quickly and avoiding lines even if it means paying bribe irks me to the core. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind having a healthy discussion, but with some so determined to pay bribe to get things done quickly and wholeheartedly oppose anyone who fights corruption, any discussion is a waste of time and energy. Many of my American friends are optimistic and talk positively (esp. knowing the Gandhi episode), but many of my own countrymen are very very skeptical and pessimistic. If well educated people don&amp;rsquo;t support a cause and act overly smart, what do you think will change? Everything has to start some way and someday, why not make this a starting point for a good future?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Do It Now, or You Might Never Get A Chance Again</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/do-it-now-or-you-might-never-get-a-chance-again/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2011 05:58:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/do-it-now-or-you-might-never-get-a-chance-again/</guid><description>&lt;p>Finally on August 20th, 2011, I skydived for the first time, not only unheeding my friends&amp;rsquo; suggestions to go for tandem first and then solo/Accelerated Free Fall (AFF) but also my own fear of jumping into the unknown. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how it will be to fall from 14,000 feet, descending at 120MPH (193KMPH). I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if the instructors will be able to guide me ntil the pull; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if the parachute will open fine or not; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I would land on Interstate-94 and get dragged down the road.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I Paid A Bribe Once</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/i-paid-a-bribe-once/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2011 05:44:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/i-paid-a-bribe-once/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I was growing up, I used to read the articles in the newspaper about people returning the money/jewelry that somebody else had lost, the auto driver returning thousands of rupees the passengers had left behind. I used to wonder what made them do what they did especially when the person who did it was indeed very poor. Why didn&amp;rsquo;t s/he keep it her/himself, used it to feed his family, made a life out of it. One moment I would think, returning it made no sense at all and the next moment I would just imagine the plight of the people who lost it. What if someone lost all their hard earned money, a life time of savings, what if if was from a poor father carrying it to arrange for his daughter&amp;rsquo;s wedding? It made perfect sense to return it. The happiness that it&amp;rsquo;d bring when one loses something precious and find it later; the good feel that it&amp;rsquo;d instill in one&amp;rsquo;s heart; the give-back/do-the-same-thing attitude that it&amp;rsquo;d bring seemed much more valuable than the actual item&amp;rsquo;s worth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Strike Out Corruption In India</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/strike-out-corruption-in-india-support-jan-lokpal-bill/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2011 07:18:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/strike-out-corruption-in-india-support-jan-lokpal-bill/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/index_archive/index_004.html">CORRUPTION IN INDIA&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Will Jan Lokpal bill solve the issue? I don&amp;rsquo;t know for sure, but it will definitely set us on the right path by giving more power to those who matter. It&amp;rsquo;s heartening to see India united to fight against the corruption. If an old man [Anna Hazare] can do so much, why can&amp;rsquo;t the youth do more? If you can, &lt;strong>PLEASE SHOW YOUR SUPPORT&lt;/strong> in any way possible. Spread the word.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
