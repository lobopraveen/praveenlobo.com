Just curious to know how many did the same. Hopefully someone will come up with the stats soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I always use different passwords on different sites. All of them are at least 10+ character long with minimum one capital, special character, and number in it. Curious to know what my friends do, I brought up this topic briefly. After the discussion, I realized that even those who are into IT, IS, computers etc. use simple, stupid passwords. Most of them even create documents with the id, password combinations and store them on their desktop! Guess what, their systems are not even encrypted!!! When you tell them about the seriousness of the issue, they just look at me and say, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not dealing with that important data here&amp;rsquo; or &amp;rsquo;nerd&amp;rsquo; or something similar.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
