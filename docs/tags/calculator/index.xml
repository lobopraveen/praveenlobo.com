He compared our current loan and what we could refinance it for and said that we would save about $12,000. I wanted to do a little bit of research before going ahead as I had not done any!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="before-i-explain">Before I Explain&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Please note that this is not an article that tells you whether you should or shouldn&amp;rsquo;t refinance. You should do your own research and decide based on your own circumstances and probably consult professionals who do this for a living. You should also read from websites run by people who do this type of work day in and day out. However, you may use the mortgage loan refinance calculator I built to do a detailed comparison. I think the calculator I built is more detailed than anything else I could find. If you find a more detailed calculator, please leave a comment.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
