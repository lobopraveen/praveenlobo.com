&lt;p>It was that time of the year again when the pumpkins are carved, people get costumed, and walk around downtown, of course, showing off. Guess what I did different this time - I carved a pumpkin! The family I was with loves cars so I thought of carving a Mustang (they own one). I made a sketch of it from a picture I had taken of their car, but decided not to do it as it&amp;rsquo;d be difficult and was probably going to take more time. I left the sketch at home and when I reached there, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to carve other than a smiley face. So, I just decided to go for the Mustang carving with the sketch out of my mind. It didn&amp;rsquo;t turn out to be a Mustang not even close, but it looks like a car at least. See them below. Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s them driving the car. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
