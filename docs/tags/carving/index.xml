      <description>Tombstone and eyeballs cupcakes
   It was that time of the year again when the pumpkins are carved, people get costumed, and walk around downtown, of course, showing off. Guess what I did different this time - I carved a pumpkin! The family I was with loves cars so I thought of carving a Mustang (they own one). I made a sketch of it from a picture I had taken of their car, but decided not to do it as it&amp;rsquo;d be difficult and was probably going to take more time.</description>
