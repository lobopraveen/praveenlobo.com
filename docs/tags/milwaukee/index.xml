      <description>Krishnamurthy. He is my oldest friend. We were in same class in Bangalore for six years starting 1990 before I had to leave. We were not in touch and had not met more than a handful of times in the last fifteen years. Then when I met him, he was still the same! He had moved to a new place and before I knew it, he was gone from there. I tried to find him but in vain.</description>

      <description>The Bastille, the medieval fortress and prison in Paris, was stormed by the demonstrators to acquire the ammunition on 14 July 1789. This day marks the start of the French Revolution and is celebrated as a national holiday in France. The same is celebrated in across the world. One such place is Milwaukee. Yes, the place I live now!
 Bastille Days is North America&amp;rsquo;s largest outdoor French themed festival held in downtown Milwaukee in Cathedral Square Park.</description>

      <description>I can write a detailed travelogue, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to bore you to death! I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m good at writing! Here is the short version! ðŸ˜ƒ
A weeks notice was all I got about my first ever business trip. To work at client&amp;rsquo;s location, to deal with client interaction, to deal with the cultural differences, and the list goes on. Though I was prepared for all of it, I was caught off guard with other stuff.</description>
