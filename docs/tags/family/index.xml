I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to ride a bike until I was thirteen or fourteen I think. My mom was too scared to allow me to ride a bicycle. I&amp;rsquo;d lie to mom and go trying to ride a bike instead of playing. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember anyone helping me how to ride. I somehow learnt by borrowing/renting bicycles on my own. We could rent bicycles from &lt;em>cycle shops&lt;/em> for one or two rupees for an hour and as soon as I collected enough money, I&amp;rsquo;d run the cycle shops, rent a bike. It was indeed liberating to just bike away and explore the part of the villages that I had never seen before.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Story Of My Childhood</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/the-story-of-my-childhood/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2011 04:54:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/the-story-of-my-childhood/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last weekend, I had one of my friend come over from Chicago. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t met him in nearly 6-7 years until a couple of days ago when I met him Chicago. We went skydiving, and visited Lake Geneva and had good time together. Meeting him brought back many memories from my childhood and school days and inspired me to write. I think, it&amp;rsquo;s time to share and put them down here before they are completely erased from my already weak memories. So, here it goes, arranged in order with my failing recollection of my childhood&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Weekend In Mangalore</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/a-weekend-in-mangalore/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2010 15:34:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/a-weekend-in-mangalore/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Update (2018): TMI galore!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mangalore. Stirs up a lot of feeling. The first city, other than Bangalore, where I spent more than a year, the city where I lived independently, the city where I gained financial independence, the city where I started watching movies (for real!), the city which has given me a few best friends, the city where I fell in love&amp;hellip; I have so many fond memories of this city that I could go on and on and on. But this post is about my visit to Mangalore last weekend.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Valentine's Day Gift</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/valentines-day-gift/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2010 18:18:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/valentines-day-gift/</guid><description>&lt;p>This valentine&amp;rsquo;s day she was very happy. She has been with me for quite long time now; I had never seen her so happy and excited in before. As I type this post she is on call and I can clearly hear her sharing it with her sister and this is her third call! &lt;strong>&lt;em>:o)&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Though she&amp;rsquo;d never tell me, I always knew that she wanted it. She is very interested in stitching, embroidery, and other creative stuff which mainly deals with fabric. She does stitch clothes at a very low price for poor women who work at construction sites. She never got support in terms of money, encouragement, or time to learn.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
