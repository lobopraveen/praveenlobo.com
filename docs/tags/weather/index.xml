While checking the weather forecast, I came up with this idea of comparing the weather between Bangalore and Milwaukee. Just for giggles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The below graphs are drawn with the data available freely on the net(weather.com, wikipedia and wunderground.com). I believe they should be fairly accurate.&lt;/p>

National Weather Service issued heat advisory; many sources reminding the deadly heat from 1995 and 1988 which took a lot of lives! The weather forecasts, news-sites, and other sources of information on the internet are terrifying.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="rewind-to-2010">Rewind to 2010&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>I landed exactly one year ago in Milwaukee. The weather was not bad. It compared to the weather I was used to in Bangalore. I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice much difference at all. Move forward to Fall, I was being constantly warned about the winter ahead! I kept hearing this for a long time as the winter arrived very late.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Winter in Milwaukee</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/first-winter-in-milwaukee/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2011 06:30:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/first-winter-in-milwaukee/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just when I started to laugh at people who were scaring me about the winter, mother nature made sure I shut up. It was a total pain to walk 6 blocks back home from office today! The main problem is the wind. If it isn&amp;rsquo;t for the wind chill factor, the winter is not much of a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s getting freaking cold here in Milwaukee; it&amp;rsquo;s expected to hit -8°F(-22°C) tomorrow and with the wind and other factors, it&amp;rsquo;s expected to feel like -27°F(-32°C). To say the least, that sucks!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
