Today was my last day at Dance Verve. Remember &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/blog/a-week-that-was/">this last paragraph&lt;/a>? A week after that I joined Dance Verve at BTM Check Post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember the very first day - I entered the class when Taj Khan (we call him sir) was not yet in. I talked to two guys (now I know them - Pavan and Manas) and sir arrived in about 15 minutes. He asked to join right then as I introduced myself. Somehow I was still very nervous and said I&amp;rsquo;d join from the next day. I didn&amp;rsquo;t forget to mention that I had never danced before (of course Salsa apart) and I tried may times and failed miserably. I used to get very conscious. He just smiled and said, it will take sometime before I can dance and I should be regular.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
