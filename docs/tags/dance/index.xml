      <description>A little sadness has taken over me. Today was my last day at Dance Verve. Remember this last paragraph? A week after that I joined Dance Verve at BTM Check Post.
I remember the very first day - I entered the class when Taj Khan (we call him sir) was not yet in. I talked to two guys (now I know them - Pavan and Manas) and sir arrived in about 15 minutes.</description>
