      <title>O_ops: Better Logging To Solve Problems</title>

      <description>Logging helps in pinpointing the code block that threw an error. Only if they are used correctly. During once such failure, a guy noticed that a script lacked logging and ever promptly promoted the updated script with better logging. A part of the script is shown below.
Script before: 1&amp;gt;&amp;gt;${LOG} 2&amp;gt;&amp;gt;${ERRLOG} ${BINPATH}/${PROGRAMNAME} if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then print &amp;#34;ERROR: Something failed&amp;#34; exit 101 fi
Script after:
1&amp;gt;&amp;gt;${LOG} 2&amp;gt;&amp;gt;${ERRLOG} ${BINPATH}/${PROGRAMNAME} echo &amp;#34;Program completed successfully.</description>

      <title>O_ops: Facebook Image Compression Sucks!</title>

      <description>Facebook [profile picture] image compression not only sucks big time, but it is also stupid. I don&amp;rsquo;t use Facebook as an image storage service, neither do I care about the EXIF data that they strip. I&amp;rsquo;m also okay with their approach to compress each and every image(?), but compressing an image which results in an image size bigger than the originally uploaded image? I think it fits in my O_ops series.</description>

      <title>O_ops: Never Return null For A Collection in Java</title>

      <description>I was enjoying a small break between the meetings when my a co-worker asked me to help her out with some Java error in the code she was working on. She was giving me walk-through of the code and I small piece of code caught my attention. Apparently, the coder knew not to return null when returning a collection.
/* Check if the list is null \*/ if(matchingCountryList != null) { return matchingCountryList; } else { return null; } Of course, it was not her code.</description>

   The best part is that once this message comes, the only way to succeed is to call the service center.</description>

      <description>I had been wondering for a last couple of days if I should start a O_ops series to just list downs things that are O_ops. Then I get this email and here I start!
It was Christmas time and I got an unusual wish from a sweetheart friend of mine.
