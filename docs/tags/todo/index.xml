      <description>HOLY MOTHER OF SWEET BABY CORN! It has seriously been a long while! 3 years? 4 years? Surprised the blog still exists! LOL! Actually not that much surprised. I pay every year to renew hosting so I know it exists! ðŸ˜›
The TODO list thing I do. Seriously, it has gotten out of hand! I have unfinished drafts from 2011, 2012, 2013 which are still not posted! I feel embarrassed; at the same time I feel overwhelmed thinking how fast the time flies!</description>

      <title>What Have I Been Up To This Summer?</title>

      <description>It has been a long time since I blogged regularly. We have a couple of weeks of summer left in 2012 and I donâ€™t want to waste that spending more time on blogging. Lately, I have been feeling like blogging is a winter activity (not saying that I blog regularly in winter). There are a number of topics blog about but no time. I keep adding topics to the todo list and keep deleting when I revisit because itâ€™s either too late or it is making the list too big.</description>

      <title>Working on The Blog</title>

      <description>This is a perfect example for a seemingly easy task taking up so much of one&#39;s time. I have been busy working on this blog for a last couple of days.Â I spent so much time and yet there are so many things to do!
Here is what I have done so far:
  Updated feed through FeedBurner: this was already present, IÂ updatedÂ some settings.
  Added Google AdSense: there comes a time in everyone&#39;s life when they turn greedy.</description>

      <title>Thanksgiving 2010 - A Long Weekend</title>

      <description>A long weekend (four days) - many of my friends are on trips visiting places. I&#39;m sitting here writing this post! I couldn&#39;t go due to work. I had to work for a couple of hours exactly in the middle of the four days so I stayed back. It sure doesn&#39;t feel good but not as bad as I imagined it to be. Almost 3/4th of the long weekend has gone by.</description>
