It has seriously been a long while! 3 years? 4 years? Surprised the blog still exists! LOL! Actually not that much surprised. I pay every year to renew hosting so I know it exists! &amp;#x1f61b;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The TODO list thing I do. Seriously, it has gotten out of hand! I have unfinished drafts from 2011, 2012, 2013 which are still not posted! I feel embarrassed; at the same time I feel overwhelmed thinking how fast the time flies!
Four fucking years! Seriously?!?!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Have I Been Up To This Summer?</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/what-have-i-been-up-to-this-summer/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Aug 2012 17:44:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/what-have-i-been-up-to-this-summer/</guid><description>&lt;p>It has been a long time since I blogged regularly. We have a couple of weeks of summer left in 2012 and I don’t want to waste that spending more time on blogging. Lately, I have been feeling like blogging is a winter activity (not saying that I blog regularly in winter). There are a number of topics blog about but no time. I keep adding topics to the todo list and keep deleting when I revisit because it’s either too late or it is making the list too big. This has been my story for past year or so. I can’t sit down and just do it. Maybe I should fix a schedule and stick to it. I don’t know.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Working on The Blog</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/working-on-the-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2011 09:16:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/working-on-the-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a perfect example for a seemingly easy task taking up so much of one&amp;rsquo;s time. I have been busy working on this blog for a last couple of days. I spent so much time and yet there are so many things to do!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is what I have done so far:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Updated feed through &lt;a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/lobopraveen">FeedBurner&lt;/a>: this was already present, I updated some settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Added Google AdSense: there comes a time in everyone&amp;rsquo;s life when they turn greedy. This is my time. &amp;#x1f61b;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thanksgiving 2010 - A Long Weekend</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/thanksgiving-2010-a-long-weekend/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2010 01:47:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/thanksgiving-2010-a-long-weekend/</guid><description>&lt;p>A long weekend (four days) - many of my friends are on trips visiting places. I&amp;rsquo;m sitting here writing this post! I couldn&amp;rsquo;t go due to work. I had to work for a couple of hours exactly in the middle of the four days so I stayed back. It sure doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel good but not as bad as I imagined it to be. Almost 3/4th of the long weekend has gone by. It&amp;rsquo;s work and someone had to do it. Moreover, it&amp;rsquo;s because of work I&amp;rsquo;m here in US in the first place so no whining.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
