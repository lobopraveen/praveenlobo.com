      <description>Dear readers,
Though there are only a few of you and I&amp;rsquo;m very sure you are very capable of finding it out yourselves, I think I must save your time and tell you that I&amp;rsquo;m moving my RSS Feed address.
The idea is simple:
 I post this post and then change my RSS feed address.  So that, assuming you miss this post, in case you wonder why you are not finding any new unread items in Lobo&amp;rsquo;s blog feed, this is the post you find on the old feed and you know the answer.</description>

      <description>This is a perfect example for a seemingly easy task taking up so much of one&amp;rsquo;s time. I have been busy working on this blog for a last couple of days. I spent so much time and yet there are so many things to do!
Here is what I have done so far:
  Updated feed through FeedBurner: this was already present, I updated some settings.
  Added Google AdSense: there comes a time in everyone&amp;rsquo;s life when they turn greedy.</description>
