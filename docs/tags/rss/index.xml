&lt;p>Though there are only a few of you and I&amp;rsquo;m very sure you are very capable of finding it out yourselves, I think I must save your time and tell you that I&amp;rsquo;m moving my RSS Feed address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea is simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I post this post and then&lt;/li>
&lt;li>change my RSS feed address.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So that, assuming you miss this post, in case you wonder why you are not finding any new unread items in Lobo&amp;rsquo;s blog feed, this is the post you find on the old feed and you know the answer. I have moved!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Working on The Blog</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/working-on-the-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2011 09:16:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/working-on-the-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a perfect example for a seemingly easy task taking up so much of one&amp;rsquo;s time. I have been busy working on this blog for a last couple of days. I spent so much time and yet there are so many things to do!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is what I have done so far:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Updated feed through &lt;a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/lobopraveen">FeedBurner&lt;/a>: this was already present, I updated some settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Added Google AdSense: there comes a time in everyone&amp;rsquo;s life when they turn greedy. This is my time. &amp;#x1f61b;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
