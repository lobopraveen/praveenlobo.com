      <description>Year 2010 was a totally different and a very special one for me. It all started in late 2009; from someone who used to talk so less and hardly socialize to wherever I am right now was quite a journey. I had a jolly good time and I wish it is one of the many years to come.
2010 had some downs, but I hardly remember them. The good ones are so many that I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to recall the bad ones.</description>
