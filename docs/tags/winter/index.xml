      <description>You know by now, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit concerned about this weather. While checking the weather forecast, I came up with this idea of comparing the weather between Bangalore and Milwaukee. Just for giggles.
The below graphs are drawn with the data available freely on the net(weather.com, wikipedia and wunderground.com). I believe they should be fairly accurate.

      <description>The weather has been truly devastating this summer (Milwaukee 2011). National Weather Service issued heat advisory; many sources reminding the deadly heat from 1995 and 1988 which took a lot of lives! The weather forecasts, news-sites, and other sources of information on the internet are terrifying.
Rewind to 2010 I landed exactly one year ago in Milwaukee. The weather was not bad. It compared to the weather I was used to in Bangalore.</description>

      <description>Lobo(Ski Brule)
    Buckhorn Chalet
   Around twenty of us drove up to Ski Brule, Iron River Michigan, on Thursday and stayed at Buckhorn Chalet right in front of the slopes. The slopes looked so beautiful and scary at the same time. I was excited to ski for the first time the very next day.

      <title>First Winter in Milwaukee</title>

      <description>Just when I started to laugh at people who were scaring me about the winter, mother nature made sure I shut up. It was a total pain to walk 6 blocks back home from office today! The main problem is the wind. If it isn&amp;rsquo;t for the wind chill factor, the winter is not much of a problem.
It&amp;rsquo;s getting freaking cold here in Milwaukee; it&amp;rsquo;s expected to hit -8°F(-22°C) tomorrow and with the wind and other factors, it&amp;rsquo;s expected to feel like -27°F(-32°C).</description>
