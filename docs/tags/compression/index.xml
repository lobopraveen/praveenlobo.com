I don&amp;rsquo;t use Facebook as an image storage service, neither do I care about the EXIF data that they strip. I&amp;rsquo;m also okay with their approach to compress each and every image(?), but compressing an image which results in an image size bigger than the originally uploaded image? I think it fits in my O_ops series.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
