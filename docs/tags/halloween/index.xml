      <description>Tombstone and eyeballs cupcakes
   It was that time of the year again when the pumpkins are carved, people get costumed, and walk around downtown, of course, showing off. Guess what I did different this time - I carved a pumpkin! The family I was with loves cars so I thought of carving a Mustang (they own one). I made a sketch of it from a picture I had taken of their car, but decided not to do it as it&amp;rsquo;d be difficult and was probably going to take more time.</description>

    Hey, that&amp;rsquo;s not!
   I was once told that people lose their inhibitions when they are behind the mask. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I agree completely.</description>

      <description>Dear blog, as you know, uh oh you don&amp;rsquo;t, do you? I never mentioned about it! I&amp;rsquo;m in US right now. The very fact that I haven&amp;rsquo;t mentioned it till now shows how busy I&amp;rsquo;m here! Naah, not really, that&amp;rsquo;s what I say when I turn lazy and forget about you. I won&amp;rsquo;t promise you that I won&amp;rsquo;t again; I can&amp;rsquo;t keep such promises. Sorry!
Anyway, this is kind of new.</description>
