&lt;p>It was that time of the year again when the pumpkins are carved, people get costumed, and walk around downtown, of course, showing off. Guess what I did different this time - I carved a pumpkin! The family I was with loves cars so I thought of carving a Mustang (they own one). I made a sketch of it from a picture I had taken of their car, but decided not to do it as it&amp;rsquo;d be difficult and was probably going to take more time. I left the sketch at home and when I reached there, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to carve other than a smiley face. So, I just decided to go for the Mustang carving with the sketch out of my mind. It didn&amp;rsquo;t turn out to be a Mustang not even close, but it looks like a car at least. See them below. Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s them driving the car. &amp;#x1f604;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Halloween 2010 - more pics</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/halloween-2010-more-pics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2010 01:37:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/halloween-2010-more-pics/</guid><description>&lt;div class='align-center'>

&lt;p>I was once told that people lose their inhibitions when they are behind the mask. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I agree completely.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Halloween 2010</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/halloween-2010/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2010 03:37:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/halloween-2010/</guid><description>&lt;p>Dear blog, as you know, uh oh you don&amp;rsquo;t, do you? I never mentioned about it! I&amp;rsquo;m in US right now. The very fact that I haven&amp;rsquo;t mentioned it till now shows how busy I&amp;rsquo;m here! Naah, not really, that&amp;rsquo;s what I say when I turn lazy and forget about you. I won&amp;rsquo;t promise you that I won&amp;rsquo;t again; I can&amp;rsquo;t keep such promises. Sorry!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, this is kind of new. Different lifestyles. Cultures. New friends. Work environment. Schedules. Meetings. Food. Currency. Everything. To some extent, I&amp;rsquo;m leading a different kind of a life which I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly prefer but don&amp;rsquo;t mind trying for some more time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
