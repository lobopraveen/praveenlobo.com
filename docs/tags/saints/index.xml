The world champions take on the New Orleans Saints. We also managed to make some time to visit the hall of fame. One thing I learned during this visit was the super bowl ring is not given just to the players but also to coaches, trainers, executives, personnel, and general staff! The winning team can present the rings to whomever they choose.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
