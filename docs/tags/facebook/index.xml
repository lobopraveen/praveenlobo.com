      <description>Krishnamurthy. He is my oldest friend. We were in same class in Bangalore for six years starting 1990 before I had to leave. We were not in touch and had not met more than a handful of times in the last fifteen years. Then when I met him, he was still the same! He had moved to a new place and before I knew it, he was gone from there. I tried to find him but in vain.</description>

      <title>O_ops: Facebook Image Compression Sucks!</title>

      <description>Facebook [profile picture] image compression not only sucks big time, but it is also stupid. I don&amp;rsquo;t use Facebook as an image storage service, neither do I care about the EXIF data that they strip. I&amp;rsquo;m also okay with their approach to compress each and every image(?), but compressing an image which results in an image size bigger than the originally uploaded image? I think it fits in my O_ops series.</description>
