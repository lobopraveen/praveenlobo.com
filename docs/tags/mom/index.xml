She has been with me for quite long time now; I had never seen her so happy and excited in before. As I type this post she is on call and I can clearly hear her sharing it with her sister and this is her third call! &lt;strong>&lt;em>:o)&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Though she&amp;rsquo;d never tell me, I always knew that she wanted it. She is very interested in stitching, embroidery, and other creative stuff which mainly deals with fabric. She does stitch clothes at a very low price for poor women who work at construction sites. She never got support in terms of money, encouragement, or time to learn.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
