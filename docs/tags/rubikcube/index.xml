&lt;p>I have driven around the stadium once while returning from the Door County last fall. This time while returning from a &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/blog/a-trip-to-pictured-rocks-michigan">trip to Pictured Rocks&lt;/a>, I visited the Lambeau Field a.k.a The Frozen Tundra and took a tour of the stadium. It was just so unbelievable to be there and to learn some history about the Packers. I even got a customized replica jersey and a Packer&amp;rsquo;s Rubik cube among other things.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Easiest Way To Solve Rubik's Cube</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/easiest-way-to-solve-rubiks-cube-without-cheating/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2011 07:06:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/easiest-way-to-solve-rubiks-cube-without-cheating/</guid><description>&lt;p>The following tutorials/videos helped me a lot in learning to solve the &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2n0eAsL">3x3 Rubik&amp;rsquo;s Cube&lt;/a>). I think these are the easiest ways to solve the rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube and hope you find it helpful too. You may find that the technique used is the same, just the explanation differs in most of the cases. Second and third videos take different approaches to solve third layer. Latter is easier and has less number of steps.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
