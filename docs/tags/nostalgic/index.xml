      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m feeling nostalgic today. Very much. I had lot of time at my hand and decided to clean up my cupboard, which I do from time to time. Until a few years back, I used to keep all things I used to have during my childhood days and one day I decided to get rid of all the junk. First time I did it, believe me, it was so painful. Each small item had so many memories associated with it, but I had to clean up stuff.</description>
