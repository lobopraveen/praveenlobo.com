      <description>My day at work had just began, when I overheard a colleague of mine talking about rule number two. He is very senior to me and is dangerously intelligent! I couldn&#39;t stop myself from asking him what the rule number two was.
&amp;ldquo;Hey, what is rule number two?&amp;quot;, I asked.
&amp;ldquo;Well, do you know rule number one?&amp;quot;, he questioned.
I replied, &amp;ldquo;Nope&amp;rdquo;, thinking why didn&#39;t I ask about rule number one first!</description>
