Quarter final match - 2010 FIFA World Cup&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was sleepy, but somehow this match seemed too good to miss. I had to wash my face with cold water to stay awake. I must tell you, it was WORTH it. Much much more than WORTH it. An exciting match. Last few moments I had my heart in my mouth. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t supporting any of the teams, but still I feel heartbroken; Ghana should have won. Unfair.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
