&lt;p>This counter acts as a count down as well as count up timer. As soon as the count down goes to 0 i.e. the future date is hit, the counter turns into a count up timer and keeps going. This counter takes a date to count the time to, an ID to put the timer in. It is possible to have more than one timer on a page. &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/media/00-25/06-counters-demo/counter-demo.html">Demo page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>JavaScript Counter</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/javascript-counter-count-days-hours-minutes-seconds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2011 05:44:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/javascript-counter-count-days-hours-minutes-seconds/</guid><description>&lt;p>I keep getting requests and I can&amp;rsquo;t help but post another JavaScript related counter!

&lt;p>This script is very simple; it takes a date to count the time from/to, an ID to put the timer in. To be very precise, this counter shows the total number of 24 hours intervals between the date-time given and current date-time. It is also possible to have more than one timer on a page. &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/media/00-25/06-counters-demo/daysHMScounter-demo.html">Demo page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Javascript Counter</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/javascript-counter-count-days/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2011 00:52:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/javascript-counter-count-days/</guid><description>&lt;p>John Watt sent me a request asking if I could help with changing the &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/blog/javascript-countup-timer/">JavaScript CountUp Timer&lt;/a> to show only the number of days in a counter. He also wanted to display the days in 3 digits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did reply with changes but it had a defect due to a last minute change! So, I wrote a clean script which is the reason for this post. One main improvement here is, the script doesn&amp;rsquo;t update every second. Updating the day counter every second is not needed since the number of days doesn&amp;rsquo;t change every second. The below script updates the counter only when the day count mentioned in the counter has to change.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>JavaScript CountUp Timer</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/javascript-countup-timer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Apr 2010 13:30:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/javascript-countup-timer/</guid><description>&lt;small>
_Update (2018):_ I have moved the code to [GitHub - JavaScript Counters](https://github.com/lobopraveen/JavaScript-Counters) AS IS.
&lt;/small>
&lt;p>I was in need of timer to mark &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/blog/quit-smoking/">an important decision&lt;/a>; I did what most of us would do - search on the internet. I found quite a few of them, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t like any of them. Some of them were unnecessarily complicated; a couple of others weren&amp;rsquo;t easily understandable; most of them were using approximation (esp. for months and years).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
