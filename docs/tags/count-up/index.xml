      <description>This might be the last one in the JavaScript Counter posts unless I make all-in-one script or a jQuery plugin off of these scripts.
This counter acts as a count down as well as count up timer. As soon as the count down goes to 0 i.e. the future date is hit, the counter turns into a count up timer and keeps going. This counter takes a date to count the time to, an ID to put the timer in.</description>

      <description>I keep getting requests and I can&amp;rsquo;t help but post another JavaScript related counter! As always, in case of any issues/doubts/suggestions, feel free to leave a comment.
JavaScript Counter to Count Days Hours Minutes Seconds - This script is very simple; it takes a date to count the time from/to, an ID to put the timer in. To be very precise, this counter shows the total number of 24 hours intervals between the date-time given and current date-time.</description>
