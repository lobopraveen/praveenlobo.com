      <description>A while ago I wrote about swget - A Simple wget Wrapper The methods described don&#39;t work for torrents. Today I had to download a video which was not available through direct download, but I found a few torrents for the same. After fiddling around with the scheduler available in Transmission I found it to be absolutely useless; it doesn&#39;t work!
After a little search on the net, I found a workaround for this too!</description>

      <description>THE PROBLEM I have BSNL 500C+ broadband connection which gives me 2.5GB of data transfer per month. This limit is sufficient only for usual surfing. 500C+ plan also gives me night unlimited option i.e. the data transferred between 2AM to 8AM is not counted towards the 2.5GB quota per month. I can download around 4GB in this time frame. I use this timeÂ to download contents, but the real problem is starting the download at 2AM.</description>
