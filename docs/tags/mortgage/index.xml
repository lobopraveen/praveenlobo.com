      <description>Like nearly every home owner right about now in America, we were thinking about refinancing and called our mortgage bank contact. He compared our current loan and what we could refinance it for and said that we would save about $12,000. I wanted to do a little bit of research before going ahead as I had not done any!
Before I Explain Please note that this is not an article that tells you whether you should or shouldn&amp;rsquo;t refinance.</description>
