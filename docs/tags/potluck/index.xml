It all started in late 2009; from someone who used to talk so less and hardly socialize to wherever I am right now was quite a journey. I had a jolly good time and I wish it is one of the many years to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2010 had some downs, but I hardly remember them. The good ones are so many that I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to recall the bad ones. In fact, I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember many of the good ones. There were a couple of things on my mind in year 2010 which I never posted. I was caught up in a lot of things and never really took time out to do it. Recently, when I was thinking about it, I was in a dilemma whether to post them now or not. Not because I don&amp;rsquo;t remember them but mainly because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to bore you to death (have I?) Anyway, since I&amp;rsquo;m using this blog also as a diary to share things, I will go ahead note them down here. All in one post!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
