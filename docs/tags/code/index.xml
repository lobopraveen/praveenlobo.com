      <description>Knowing what the hell you are doing is very important and in the world of programming, letting others know what the hell you are doing is just as important.
We, at least some of us, code for a living. We cannot support it forever. We might change profession, move on to a &amp;lsquo;grass is greener&amp;rsquo; place, worst yet we might not exist at all! There will always be another person working on our code, making a living trying to fix the issues (that we thought will never exist), making it better suite the &amp;lsquo;current world&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Around three months ago, I was shocked looking at some newly added code in one of our applications. It was naked. Not a single line of comment whatsoever!! I asked the person who wrote it to explain the code and it turned out that the code is indeed very cleverly written. I&amp;rsquo;d rate the code as top notch if only it had comments. When I demanded an explanation, it turned out that he thinks commenting is an utterly boring task.</description>
