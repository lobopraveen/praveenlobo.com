      <title>Java: Get Sub List of Elements between two elements (instead of indexes) in a List</title>

      <description>Update: moved the code to github
Java List APIs provides a way to get the elements (sub-list) in a List between two indexes using List subList(int fromIndex, int toIndex). However, there is no API to get the elements in a List between two list elements List subList(Object fromElement, Object toElement). The following code is an example to get the elements (sub-list) &amp;ldquo;between two list elements&amp;rdquo;. This works even if the given element doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in the List - imagine a list of items with different prices and a sub-list of items between price X and price Y when, say, there are no items with price X or Y.</description>
