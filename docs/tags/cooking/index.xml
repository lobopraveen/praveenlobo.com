      <description>You know by now. Indians are the world champions! Yeah, say that again, WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS!
Remember &amp;ldquo;More than a billion hearts and one shared dream&amp;rdquo;? That&#39;s what I wrote when the world cup started. That dream has come true! Now more than 50% of Indian population can proudly say they saw their captain lift the world cup at least once in their life. Glory!
Homepage mania: I dedicated the homepage to Green Bay Packers and they won the super bowl; they are the Champions!</description>

      <description>This is Sunday afternoon, I&#39;m bored and I&#39;m planning to prepare Chocolate Brownies. I have never prepared it before and looking at the instructions on the pack, I must say it is not big deal at all. All you need is, well, Chocolate Brownie mix, some eggs and vegetable oil. I&#39;m off.
PS: Okay, I don&#39;t have anything to blog about. Big deal. üòù

      <title>Eat Oatmeal Idiots</title>

      <description>I know, the subject is a bit harsh, but it&#39;s well suited for all comments I get from my room-mates about eating oats. Oats is one of the food that I just love. I first started having oatmeal three years ago when I came across many articles on the net. I felt like, it was made for me! Why? It&#39;s simple, easy to prepare, healthy.
Believe it or not with very little or no exercise I was able to cut down all fat and lose weight just by controlling eating habits.</description>

      <description>This was in draft mode for over 5 months now! There is something with me and updating this blog. There are a couple of more drafts. I plan to post all of them in next two weeks.
If I&#39;m not following the recipes which I read somewhere, I will keep it very simple. First I check what are the items I can use, then etch a plan, pick the items, and cook.</description>

      <description>Keep the ingredients ready
   I wanted to show off my culinary skill (if I have any üòõ) the other day when I made a chicken dish, unfortunately, I forgot to post it. This was in draft mode for over 5 months now! I had completely forgotten about it until yesterday when I started preparing biriyani. Publishing it now, enjoy. üòÉ
