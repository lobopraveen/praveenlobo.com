Indians are the world champions! Yeah, say that again, WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember &amp;ldquo;More than a billion hearts and one shared dream&amp;rdquo;? That&amp;rsquo;s what I &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/blog/2011-world-cup-men-in-blue-will-rock-the-world/">wrote&lt;/a> when the world cup started. That dream has come true! Now more than 50% of Indian population can proudly say they saw their captain lift the world cup at least once in their life. Glory!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I dedicated the &lt;a href="https://praveenlobo.com/index_archive/index_002.html">homepage&lt;/a> to Green Bay Packers and they won the super bowl; they are the Champions!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Preparing Chocolate Brownie</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/preparing-chocolate-brownie/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2011 23:08:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/preparing-chocolate-brownie/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is Sunday afternoon, I&amp;rsquo;m bored and I&amp;rsquo;m planning to prepare Chocolate Brownies. I have never prepared it before and looking at the instructions on the pack, I must say it is not big deal at all. All you need is, well, &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2BkwBHq">Chocolate Brownie mix&lt;/a>, some eggs and vegetable oil. I&amp;rsquo;m off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS: Okay, I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to blog about. Big deal. &amp;#x1f61d;&lt;/p>

Oats is one of the food that I just love. I first started having oatmeal three years ago when I came across many articles on the net. I felt like, it was made for me! Why? It&amp;rsquo;s simple, easy to prepare, healthy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Believe it or not with very little or no exercise I was able to cut down all fat and lose weight just by controlling eating habits. Needless to say one of the main ingredients (and the only one for sometime) being oats!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Culinary Skills - III</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/my-culinary-skills-iii/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2010 05:04:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/my-culinary-skills-iii/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another one from the old drafts.

There is something with me and updating this blog. There are a couple of more drafts. I plan to post all of them in next two weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I&amp;rsquo;m not following the recipes which I read somewhere, I will keep it very simple. First I check what are the items I can use, then etch a plan, pick the items, and cook. That is exactly what I did today. The recipes are very simple and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to type it - I&amp;rsquo;m a little bored to do that now. May be some other day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Culinary Skills - I</title><link>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/my-culinary-skills-i/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jun 2010 20:23:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://praveenlobo.com/blog/my-culinary-skills-i/</guid><description>&lt;div class='align-center'>

&lt;p>I wanted to show off my culinary skill (if I have any &amp;#x1f61b;) the other day when I made a chicken dish, unfortunately, I forgot to post it. This was in draft mode for over 5 months now! I had completely forgotten about it until yesterday when I started preparing biriyani. Publishing it now, enjoy. &amp;#x1f603;&lt;/p>
