      <description>I have been telling myself that I will get back into blogging again and again in vain. I have a bunch of drafts that I have not posted; I keep thinking about posting them and posting my views about current affairs and daily life. For some reason I just can&amp;rsquo;t commit to it. I feel like I have hit this big writer&amp;rsquo;s block and I somehow don&amp;rsquo;t want to get out if it.</description>

      <description>I recently moved a bunch of blog posts to a new blog installation. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessary but just an exercise to learn what it takes to move the posts. It was easy after a lot of reading. Here is a checklist I prepared. Hope it helps someone looking for similar stuff. Comments and suggestions are welcome. Use it at your own risk!
 WordPress: Install WordPress.
 Plugins: Install necessary plugins.</description>

      <description>When you start out with the WordPress, it&amp;rsquo;s common to assume that each blog needs a separate WordPress installation. But there&amp;rsquo;s a simpler way. WordPress Multisite installation. This lets one have different blogs with just one installation of WordPress. But, why did I choose not to use it?
Advantges and Disadvantages of WordPress Multisite Advantages:  The multisite blogs have all features of a regular blog with just one installation i.</description>

      <description>What is a blog slug? If you have no clue, this post isn&amp;rsquo;t for you and if you want to know what it is, it is an ugly looking additional &amp;ldquo;/blog/&amp;rdquo; in the permalinks (URLs) in your website that comes free with the multisite feature in WordPress. Why ugly? Because it comes uninvited, it&amp;rsquo;s there and most probably you don&amp;rsquo;t want it.
How do you remove the additional &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; in the URL of your posts?</description>

      <description>Continued from here&amp;hellip;
Advantages/Disadvantages: Advantages of multiple blogs include monetization, ease of finding advertisers, reaching right audience, and building a resource of articles all in the same niche. Disadvantages? Unless you are an expert you will run out of good articles, might have to hire writers. Multiple blogs needs more time in terms of maintenance, updates etc. It needs more resources which cost money.
You will have enough time on your hand with a single blog and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about all blogs that miss your constant love.</description>

      <description>Is it possible to create a blog in a sibling directory of an already installed WordPress directory? If yes, how to? If not, can it be done on a fresh installation? 1. Existing Installation: Assume that the domain is praveenlobo.com and there is an existing WordPress installation in /blog directory (so, praveenlobo.com/blog is a WordPress blog and the root directory at praveenlobo.com is free). Now, is it possible to create a networked site or blog at praveenlobo.</description>

      <description>This is a perfect example for a seemingly easy task taking up so much of one&amp;rsquo;s time. I have been busy working on this blog for a last couple of days. I spent so much time and yet there are so many things to do!
Here is what I have done so far:
 Updated feed through FeedBurner: this was already present, I updated some settings.
 Added Google AdSense: there comes a time in everyone&amp;rsquo;s life when they turn greedy.</description>
